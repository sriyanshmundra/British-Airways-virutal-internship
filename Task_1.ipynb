              " [\"this was a night flight new york jfk to london so it was difficult to assess the service onboard although what i experienced was certainly not bad i think this was a very quiet flight judging from the number of people around the gate and there were only another 4-5 pax in first but it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin the former felt very exclusive but as commented elsewhere to the point of being fussy it's irritating that they don't have any showers in the concorde room; i wasn't amused to check in at the galleries (business) lounge be brusquely sent on to concorde only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm early august in nyc - of course i needed a shower) departures from ny were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway but we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne seved by various members of the crew likewise all the perks of first class were there; i was addressed by name the crew introduced themselves individually dinner and drinks orders were taken etc all very courteous and professional after such a long delay i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine and was served promptly so there was still plenty of time for sleep but the soup was cold and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class moreover it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had i known this i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t5 arrivals toiletsperhaps you saw me) the cabin layout and bed: well it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online but it's certainly nothing special for first class overall a very acceptable flight but i felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing (where can i have a shower in the morning where will i be having breakfast) i've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects\"],\n",

            "having experienced delays and cancellations departing from usa to europe and now a 35 hour estimated delay at lhr heading back to usa i would warn travelers that ba has become unreliable and is now on my “do not fly” list until they get better organized, travelled to heathrow to kalamata and return journey 11 days later world traveller (aka economy) class both flights departed on time return flight landed early - but - we then had a 1 1/4 hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure flights ok - fa's (particularly on return flight) pleasant enough but as usual economy class seating was truly dreadful - no legroom at all no better in club class either - only the middle seat left free marked down because of this can only recommend if you are not tall, this flight failed at every level we were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a ba holiday we pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound british airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in heathrow as there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on wednesday evening having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday i might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available i would like to make it clear that we are british airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically, i flew with numerous airlines but i gotta admit british airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support i waited 3 weeks for a ticket change call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up they told me i was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes but never got they don't have a live chat just like american airlines do they don't have a online form to submit your questions they don t have a working international number total garbage, we were traveling as a family (5 people) because of an accident by the airport we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight the kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check-in the lady at the check-in checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass because we had no extra time we headed straight to security and didn’t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder) we got stuck in security because of that couldn’t figure out what was wrong we only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party the staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there, an excellent flight in club world on british airways the welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight the crew were attentive friendly and very professional on board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines in flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio the seat/flat bed was very comfortable - british airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the a350 i liked the sleek minimalist design this flight showed that ba can be among the world’s best airlines, busy day at lhr and flight full lounge crowded but b gates lounge quieter flight left on time very professional crew greeted by name and executive club status acknowledged and thanked for return custom a nice touch service was good food average entertainment good early arrival quick processing at jfk all good, online check in worked fine quick security check once onboard quick flight up to glasgow water and snack provided all in all very pleased cheap quick and efficient, paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant i paid over £300 for a business class round trip i went into the to ba lounge in terminal 5 which was very crowded being 630 in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering the cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate b36 and waited there for 40 mins boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2a and 2c seat 2b was blocked out which acted as an additional table there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in terms on no frills it would not cost ba that much to supply business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight the inflight magazine is no longer available there are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment the inflight wifi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times i was glad it was only a two hour flight i really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money, only the second time flying ba as first time wasn’t positive could have made my connection in heathrow if ba had been proactive instead overnight at the renaissance hotel compliments of ba adequate but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers if ba had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving we could have made our flight and saved ba the cost of rebooking hotel shuttle food accommodations another bad show business class fare should offer more, i wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise after having our flight class reduced from first to business then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment they then reneged on this as it was a special anniversary it sucked flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats unbelievable the flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable this meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food the crew was great but what an earth is going on at ba they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time i say this as the new club suites are great, second time ba premium economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in hong kong this was a very pleasant flight seats are spacious and comfortable in premium economy in this layout attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good they communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind a very pleasant experience in ba premium economy after a major disappointment in club world earlier this year, at copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlines time on board never changed no fixed counter at airport abysmal service that needs vast improvement here, lhr check in was quick at the first wing and quickly through security the first lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available while ba have brought back their highlife magazine in the lounge it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer as part of the endless ba cost cutting the toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in t5 are better and cleaner) boarding was the usual ba muddled mess and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight requesting passengers to check in bags only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard no hot towels or even packet towels offered in club europe any more another part of the relentless ba cost cutting i wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid cabin staff service was perfunctory at best not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald members clear proof that ba really don't care any more breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight paid £499 for 1 hours wifi and dropped connection for the next 40 mins sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga this is standard for ba business class baggage handling do not waste your money on club europe standards just keep dropping, i enjoyed my flight the boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional the food selection was good and i enjoyed the quality the was only one downside - when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at t5 so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took 30 minutes i believe the heathrow t5 were having strike action that week, after several delays and canceled flights we finally made it to copenhagen on american airlines and british airways flights my luggage was destroyed wheels torn off i had to buy new luggage in denmark i made a claim with british airways to reimburse me but because i didn’t have the receipt for my old luggage they would only cover 50% of my new luggage advice have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don’t get ripped off like i did, i swore i would never fly ba again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to budapest but the times for their flights suited me so i decided to give them another go the flight left on time (just about) the cabin was clean and the staff friendly there was even complimentary tea/coffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy the flight was pleasant enough and i can't think of any negatives to write about the flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet, i have flown with ba for many years and there was a time about 10 years ago when they were getting better sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines at booking time one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat at heathrow t5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least the lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and ba has not invested in them for many years on the flight the food was okay although portions are kept minimal this was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight next time they change ceo can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate budget irish airline, boarding at mumbai was chaotic and badly organised once on board the crew announcements were professional relaxed and informative in typical ba style the seat was quite comfortable it was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good i was lucky that the middle seat was empty so i didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which i think would have made it a lot less comfortable the ife is excellent responsive and good quality there is an enormous selection of tv and movies and a good number of games wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i don’t think £1799 for full flight is bad value you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough landing and processing at heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am even though it was 6:30pm no queues or waiting at all even the baggage was super quick at coming through overall a very solid experience in economy significantly better than it used to be, mexico city airport is a zoo but taking the late departure on ba to lhr isn't too bad club passengers can use the aa admirals lounge which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to ba's club passengers only at this time of day lovely staff solid food & bar really pleasant we flew an older 787 with the old style club seats seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner come to think of it i will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out there is no better way to fly when you are a couple we were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle still terrible you have to pay for these seats but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats flying ba when the crew is good is amazing service was impecable on this flight just the right mix of humor service and attention food seemed to be good as well but hardly touched it i am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better on time departure smooth flight and early arrival at heathrow we went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track security at lhr has always been terrible but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks we had a lovely shower at the 'spa' what a fabulous facility the south lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess food on offer was solid and so are the drinks our home stretch to amsterdam was pretty straight forward lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service i love the 'double'-servings of drinks english tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and i really don't understand ba stuck to it through the years no-one like the cucumber white bread things but hey on time landing in amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in amsterdam flying club in ba is still wonderful i love it, ba changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to select new seats flight took off late cabin crew served a tiny packet of pretzels arrived at heathrow late put on a remote stand loaded onto buses to terminal held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff allowed 15 passengers at a time because of a trial queued at security for 20 minutes, first time flying with british airways and first time flying to the americas from india via london heathrow i chose premium economy at a reasonable price i was quite comfortable however the first leg of the flight from mumbai to heathrow the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest the second leg from heathrow to nassau the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable cabin service was fine - i appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping the meals weren't that great to be honest after landing in heathrow we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate my connection was less than an hour long the ba staff in the heathrow airport helped me move through security quickly and i made it with time to spare for my next flight when i arrived in nassau i found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in london the ba baggage representative in nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim my luggage arrived on the next ba flight a few days later and british airways nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island i was staying on very impressive and efficient, our flight out to dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from london gatwick not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board i understand why the likes of easyjet ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone outbound lgw-dbv: boarding was fairly quick easy and efficient and we took off on time pilot announcements clear professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up toilets clean and maintained appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid inbound dbv-lgw: for some reason no online or app check-in available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities no queue at manual check-in though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport was empty at that hour with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason it's truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off pilots for this flight were unpolished with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to no apology for delay cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones ba are installing from row 14 onwards these seats have barely any padding so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable we landed 55 minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours we'd spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly ba as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences but it's by no measure good just the least bad option given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard, as usual the flight is delayed this week it already 3 hours and i’m held on a bus waiting to get taken to the plane i really can’t explain how much i detest british airways if it was a cheap budget airline i could accept it but it’s premium prices for the most unreliable service, a short ba euro trip and this is where ba excel clean aircraft good crew professional on time (within lhr standards) and a good value product delivered pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food options but good overall check in self service is great now once you know how to use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who can’t, would happily fly them again i had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge onboard service on lhr-ist was no frills but jfk-lhr was impeccable: good food lots of movies/cds on the ife open bar service the entire flight friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drink/snack, flew premium only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room penny pinching means there’s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight no fizz offered before take off poor food boarding was badly organised food left on tables 30 min before landing with no tea and coffee offered few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this new planes have been decorated terribly - feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room devoid of any personality or joy only fly if the only option only fly premium if it’s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days especially if you’re in the middle 4, although it was a bit uncomfortable flight in an economy the flight attendants made the flight the best possibly could  such a nice and professional crew very attentive and looking out for their customers, boarding was decently organised the a380 still has the rather strange configuration in club world where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite position the a380 was nearly full rather poor amenity bag the welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantry the meal was ok but not great aside the champagne no european wines on this flight service was friendly but rather slow no spontaneous refills of drinks offered acceptable continental style breakfast extremely narrow restrooms without any lotions or similar it was an acceptable experience nothing more after landing 50 minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority, boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to london heathrow that is very ok the a320 with rather narrow seats in business light meal a caesars salad a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks - nothing wrong for such a short flight fa's were very friendly and landing on time, my original flight was cancelled just over 2 weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available british airways affected the trip i planned it feels like ba is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service, very competent check in staff saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted i could not take exit seat moved me to row 30 where the middle seat was empty on the other hand on board - huge line for toilets - 45 min into a 230 min flight a crew member realised one of the toilets is closed - as crew had put their luggage there they announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow on asking why: \"they did not give us enough cups for hot drinks and the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip\" a bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar, check in was so slow no self check in and bag drop boarding was ok flight totally full booked row 9 which was ok some space in overhead bins seat and legroom ok cabin crew ok smiled gave out the bottle of water and pretzels flight itself was ok landed 25 mins early and then waited 30 minutes for a stand and ground crew bags came off reasonably quickly ba still seems to believe it is something special a premium carrier the reality is that it is not the only reason we flew ba was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year ba is our carrier of last choice, this was my first time flying with ba & i was pleasantly surprised islamabad via doha was very comfortable and the crew were great friendly and helpful the second flight was operated by qatar airways this was from doha to islamabad my return journey was a direct ba flight 46kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights crew on this flight were really nice too what let ba down was the food it really was not nice the ife could do with some more content but that's not really a huge issue, lots of cancellations and delays and no one apologized edinburgh to london on feb 14th 2023 our original flight was cancelled and the rebooked one was cancelled as well the third rebooked one was supposed to departure at 12:50 and had several delays until 2:24 then we had to wait 57 minutes for our luggage to arrive, ba 242 on the 6/2/23 boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed in flight services were excellent the crews were friendly with excellent service overall very happy with ba, not only my first flight in 17 years but also my first time back to england for 17 years i flew from pmi-lgw on 21/01/2023 and returned on 29/01/2023 both wizz air and easyjet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage british airways were the most convenient and best value option available they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable - total cost for both flights was €126 +/- regular update information via email seamless online seat allocation and check in efficient staff at the check in desks at pmi and lgw ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible immaculate aircraft comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom (i'm 6'4\" tall) cabin crew were polite friendly and professional in flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced i enjoyed the meat ploughman's and ipa beer (€10 -/+ total) on both flights i have flown 80+ times in the last 50 years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one lgw-lhr helicopter transfer flying was a totally different experience 'back in the day' we are now in the age of the 'budget airline' nostalgia aside british airways are the best airline i've flown with, my husband and myself were flying to madrid on the 3rd of february for a legal matter and we had to be in madrid by 13:00 pm we had booked our flight and car with ba holidays unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before we got lost and missed our 6:00 am flight to madrid i tried to stay calm cold head and we went to british airways to get help the first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with ba holidays we didn't know that she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldn't do anything else that we had to call that number we called the number which was asking us to call another  number which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm we went back to the lady and explained that we couldn't wait until 8 am but she told us that she could not do anything i did reach out to another staff  a lovely young lady called althea she started to look at it made several calls went to check with someone else to an office she managed to get someone to send me a text message that i had to call and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 730 am they didn't charge us for that our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to madrid without the support of the lovely althea her professionalism her care for us we would not have make it she was so sweet so caring but at the same time so determined to help she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities, organised boarding process really friendly crew quick drink and a snack all in all a great experience the crew are a credit to ba the best crew in europe, check in agent at lhr was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew seat was comfortable with good leg room however the food was poor - barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selections we’re very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money, excellent service both on the ground and on board - while their first class product might not be leading edge the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket the concorde room at heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip flight was slightly delayed out of heathrow but arrived on schedule in johannesburg, good lounge at cape town on time departure drinks high quality sound dinner service breakfast reasonable arrival lounge was good but showers cold, a really excellent journey lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon plenty of edible food easy boarding new club world suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards- choice of individual wines rather than bland blends courses served individually with cut glass and china beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup crew excellent good choice of movies breakfast after a good night's sleep- fruits etc first couldn't manage the full english which was offered arrival on time what more could you want not quite up to gulf standards overall but ba seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard, as a spanish born individual living in england i have been using british airways for over 3 decades multiple times a year on 12th january 2023 i booked a flight for my son and i to go to alicante however i was informed on the 17th january 2023 by my doctors that i am unable to fly due to an elbow operation i have had as a result i decided to give my ticket to my daughter calling up the customer service team for british airways to make the change on the 18th january 2023 they took my enquiry call there seemed to be some speech delay in the call which presented a small bit of difficulty however i also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay when requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name i was told this is not within the policy and that i would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it i was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers i accepted this and was then asked if i would like to cancel the booking i insisted i would need to know the total of the refund it’s lucky i did ask to check this as i was then informed it would be roughly £900 the total cost of my booking was £39464 which comes to £19732 per passenger leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase this is despite the seat not be abandoned according to ba  policy all i am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when i’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago), a rather empty and quiet flight to tel aviv very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight i had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us otherwise an overall excellent flight on ba's part this was the first time i have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time, easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to ba security at london was fast galleries north was fine and showers were good organised flight boarding plane was fine with good crew and new club world product my wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok after take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run slept well on time arrival we both found the new seat design harder to sleep in, i find ba incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers i have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although i know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage there was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug when i challenged why i had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - i was told it was a short haul fight my sisters met me from cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance drinks food and inflight entertainment as well as a usb port to charge their phones ba i now realise stands for budget airline staff were great - what you got for your money not so much, great thing about british airways a380 is the economy section upstairs get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats despite being not very old the a380 looked tired inside broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react ife the food was supposed to be christmas dinner 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes poor in taste and quality mousse desert was great though slight issue during the snack meal ordered a childs option which was marked as such regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box staff were ok couple decent but mostly just ok overall ba just seems a tad cheap these days great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended just seemed a bit dull and like ba are just an average airline, the staff are friendly the plane was cold we were shivering they gave light blankets but they were not enough meals were basic entertainment was basic luggage is delayed today is day 6 and ba staff over the phone say \"call after 72 hours\" tracking system is very vague had to extract information from staff that they arrived to vancouver on jan 2nd i offered to collect baggage but very vague answer \"call the airport\" asked her for ba phone number at yvr but she said \"we don't have a phone number for you to call call the main airport\" their policy states you can make a claim only after 21 days, ba shuttle service across the uk is still surprisingly a good product when compared with ba long haul that doesn’t always get the best of comments at times it’s reasonable priced works well fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk i don’t know why they still offer a covid style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service currently they have an on line sky cafe but it’s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips, i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews but had my first ride on a ba a380 the other day so it was an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that’s about it ife didn’t work but wasn’t that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down some skirts some trouser suits some long sleeves some short some jackets some waistcoat some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better i think baggage delivery was really quick summing up well i am still not coming back to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon, when will ba update their business class cabin - 8 across on a 777 it is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares as for having to pay to reserve a specific seat - an antiquated idea the cabin staff were fine food acceptable check-in ok and business lounge (breakfast) acceptable the lack of space in the seating area small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive, old a320 with narrow pitch flight perfectly on time with constant announcements from cockpit friendly staff free chips and water quick luggage delivery at t5, another ba shambles started off well with excellent check in at first at t5 mid afternoon so avoided the early morning evening scrum into the concorde lounge excellent service again great choice of cocktails wine etc food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable called to the boarding gate chaos people jostling for position to get on the plane people with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5 we get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all so the lights were on all night it was like being detained and interrogated excellent wine and champagne selection dinner menu handed out i’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please no you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1a got it i bet he felt like he’d won the lottery ok i’ll have the beef wellington basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce mains  i’ll have the curry no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with christmas dinner  i’m going to the maldives to get away from christmas i ended up with short ribs that were inedible no salad starter no water offered no bread roll i just couldn’t eat it so basically my husband and i have spent £20000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving no apologies watch out ba as virgin start flying direct in october as always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots, boarding – at gate at lgw they called group 1 to board (we were world traveller plus & group 3) then called \"anyone in groups 2-6\" whereupon everyone else surged forward why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them cabin crew - treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane at one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past and without even a word no acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past service – we were in the final row of six in wt+ (which has a total of 48 seats) the lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 wt+ meals there was a second hot meal served before we landed again the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left i asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal and she said she hadn’t thought of that food – some of it was inedible vegetarian cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it the bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half only thing i could eat was the baby bel in between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread pretty basic drinks – they ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight toilets – there was no toilet accessible directly from the wt+ section we had to walk halfway down the plane through economy to reach a shared toilet we flew virgin atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (premium economy) and it was so much better organised boarding sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in ba) food options available (even in last row seats) better food proper glasses/cups for drinks dedicated toilet access help yourself snacks helpful service from cabin crew we will not be looking to fly ba over virgin in future, seat horribly narrow; 3-4-3 on a 777 thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows cabin crew very good booked as a ba ticket that included travel on qatar airways as well, when i tried to check in online i was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300 i decided to take it but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in i phoned ba and was happy that the call was picked up quickly but i was then told that because i had changed my booking i had to check in at the airport so we turned up three hours before the flight only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium the check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the ba desk airside that desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line we were told to try at the boarding gate at the gate we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window not sitting together after going through that the flight was surprisingly good with decent food and very good service we flew back economy which wasn't too bad either the flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic and emma and daniel who looked after us could not have been better i've obviously learned my lesson about late ba upgrades but everything else was good, i flew from prague to lhr excellent service attentive staff first drink service then meal service (choice of three meals) later second drink service in reality - excellent flight couple of days later i flew back from lhr to prague boarding at lhr t5 was a total chaos onboard service cannot really be called service: no curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet) meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet) i don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you i was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink why would we bother serving you also a scone hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when i asked for my scone it came as a surprise i was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew)  crew busy chatting at the galley in reality - the service could not get any worse one just must ask what do you pay the premium price for, booked a ba holiday to marrakech after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit i can now confirm that the points have been credited it took a while but ba did eventually make good on their promise thank you based on things now being resolved i have travelled on ba since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on 2nd january looking forward to the new ba concorde lounge keep it up ba loyalty is indeed a 2way street, i virtually gave up on british airways about three years ago writing off my avios and opting for other airlines but my return flights from heathrow to lisbon this week were very good the aircraft were pretty much full but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good a particular shout-out to a flight attendant called jo but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive i'm going to have to start spending those avios, i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service while the food was typical air plane food i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights, flew from amman to london on nov 14 2022 not sure what type of aircraft it was my ticket was economy plus the flight is 5h35m we received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system any other food or drink had to be purchased so we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas it is the third time i have flown with ba recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review will honestly never fly them again if i can help it, beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to ba two pieces reported 29th september ba responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service, i booked the flight on oct 8 but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i can't get my entry visa in time for the flight and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled but in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different one so i requested cancellation but ba canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email i assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than 3 weeks i still have not received any refund so i reached out and it turned out my flight is still on and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba i tried multiple different ways phone calls and emails but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty based on my experience no ones reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in given all i have experienced i have zero faith in british airways, i’ve generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route i’m after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get we should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 45 hours late not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed they couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough that was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service they were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board we’re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march this was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight , a great flight the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british has returned to full service so meals were coursed menus and hot towels provided…etc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals service was ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference entertainment was good as was connectivity no real complaints except a minor one the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position i actually felt like i was in a true business class not by qatar’s standards but that’s another story, i am happy to say that this flight was quite good except for the second rate euro business seating everything was very well done a friendly informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit well done unfortunately a bus gate was used upon arrival, just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable but times have changed these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all the terminal 5 experience still feels classy and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient on board though it’s just become an experience to be endured ba’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane and nastier for the rest underlines this there is no entertainment no magazine refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day despite the competition being able to do this is it too much to ask for when trapped on board for five hours you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed on the return flight for one reason or another due to ba’s delays from the previous day we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight altogether i would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for; and that is a pity because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys, a very positive experience with ba seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep food was fine but not outstanding wi-fi good and video screen large and bright baggage came out very quickly at heathrow had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta all in all would fly ba again but would probably want to make sure it is new seats, evening flight from lhr to iad on an a380 check in at t5 is poor most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called boarding was very poorly managed the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft the flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful they did their job very professionally and efficiently they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble they started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a 75 hour flight the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight all in it was an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention, while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating i got faint due to that heat but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response, lhr-lax i prefer the boeing 777 over the a380 as the seats don't seem too cramped check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at heathrow t5 is a whole other story once through security its up the escalator up the stairs up the elevator down the escalator get to the gate no seating then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t5 before anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight the entertainment system was good with decent options so i occupied my time with several movies nice landing at lax all in all ba was just fine, flew back to uk from miami in new club world suite - a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world boarding easy took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces bedding and large pillow supplied attentive fa's - especially anna who addressed me by name) however let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife) and sadly once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen refused to pay ba's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees and still got 2 seats together c'mon ba - do we not pay enough already to travel club class  i can recommend ba's new club class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future, i flew with hand baggage but security at dubai was quick entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound flight on a380 left on time few technical issues with ife which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight decent snack and slept well arrivals lounge excellent would recommend, london to cairo first on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water even southwest is more generous when unable to connect my phone to order food i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour when the fa came to collect garbage i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter he used his phone to place the order, this review is specifically about maddie crew member who took care of us she was attentive warm friendly and nothing was too much trouble smiling from start to finish she should be the brand ambassador for ba, 5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft no inflight entertainment in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase, dfw-lhr had an easy transfer at dfw from american airlines to british airways heading to london first ride on an a380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy but the seats and rows were very cramped when the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen the seat itself wasn't too bad but i felt squished and locked in on a plus side having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack the entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies tv music and games all in all it was an ok experience and did get me to london on time and our baggage arrived safely but i'm not sold on the a380 t5 at lhr is another story that will be in a different review what a mess that place is, check in at lhr t5 was very quick and queue for security short we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together flight boarded on time whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding glass of champagne coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter in spite of some of the issues with ba their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly, the check-in process was smooth i got access to the iga lounge which was nice but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge on board was what all this flight was about this was my first time flying intra-european business class and though i was well prepared i still found it underwhelming first the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off there is no personal ife so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight meal service was very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin one of the 2 choices ran out plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago i could see that staff did their best but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there was so much they could do also the 32 passengers shared one single wc meaning a long line for the bath room something i have rarely seen in business class arrived at lhr we did not get a contact gate but the thing was that there was no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come it finally came of course and the delay was more on the airport than the airline but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t5 such things will affect their reputation, this is my first time flying ba's new club suite which in my opinion is very good flight to the us including mine departed from concourse c of terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options however it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy the highlight is the club suite which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy meal service was slow and everything was served on one tray all at once i think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard at least the food tasted good which was not something i previously experienced on ba flights even in first class, i would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey i don’t know how you manage to keep smiling couldn’t fault anything helpful reassuring excellent food and i can’t wait to fly again thank you and i really appreciated you, british airways personnel was just magnificent my flight into london was delayed security had long lines i ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board (the software program was already closed) this while the flight manager who came towards the gate urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line i was sweating from the run still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board i bolted again into the plane feeling bad that i did not personally thank her for her magic i really hope she gets recognized by british airways for her performance thank you for all you do , good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39j and lack of good leg room meal was good from singapore should be more snacks on board my neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didn’t work, flight was 1 hour late leaving gate crew were friendly seats comfortable but the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps, after having a few not so good experiences in the past i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved first of all the improvement in the ba lounge in gatwick is massive the buffet was a joy we flew on a ba flight but operated by iberia express wonderful staff and the food was exceptional whoever brought in this change of food supplier  congratulations also may i add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service i am still not clear on luggage being labelled \"priority\" the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports, this review is for ba booking system not a flight  today i clicked wrong date on line my mistake and expect to pay a fee i then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didn’t want however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when so they now have my money and i have to re-book at full cost in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up, our flight in march 2022 from san francisco to london on 28th march was cancelled with 3 hours’ notice we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport we had to stay overnight for the next day flight we still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups it is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up during this trip we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill) this should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable we were given a voucher this voucher was only bookable by phone when i phoned to rebook we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by phone you can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings  all i have been offered is another voucher the time to use has passed it must be great to be a business that can print endless a4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered we returned home with aer lingus with no drama, i sat in seat 25c our cabin crew lady was called gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy she greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing she had time for a quick chat and i think she said she was half german and half bulgarian a really lovely young lady who is a credit to british airways, full afternoon flight ready to fly on time arrived early uneventful flight good service pre dinner drinks drink with meal coffee drinks available at back avml meal was tasty hard working crew on a full flight audio worked well, having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed i boarded the plane on this basis i was subsequently dumped at barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor there was no help at there to find a hotel i have ms and can't walk without help ba did nothing their partners iberia did nothing at about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches i lost my holiday my hotel booking and my music course ba insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing i would not have got on the plane had i known i found out i could go to arbitration ba now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if i do their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger is bad enough for someone who is not mobile it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers so for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with ba, barbara collins was super helpful my boyfriend & i booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate slightly later one barbara was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together & even managed to put us sitting together much appreciate ba we had a terrific flight over food drinks & nibbles were great & staff were so friendly looking forward to returning home with ba, my husband parents who are in their 80’s and i were traveling back to ny from naples italy and had a stopover at heathrow london let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight back to ny the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult but she got it done she is so kind and is amazing at her job, we had a nice flight pushed-off exactly on time cabin crew very efficient in all things; friendly for the most part as well dinner (hot) and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good do avoid middle seats though even in premium economy only issue was with indifferent/non-helpful ba call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance nice start to a 3 week trip to england, despite ba's promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website i have received no additional points and my four email communications (including to the chief executive) have remained unanswered do not be taken in by this marketing con - they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises some things just do not change at ba, flight on a380 sfo to lhr smooth check in at san francisco airport quiet and efficient dedicated ba lounge excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff lounge was very crowded though minor departure delay and onto a380 upper deck i prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter old style product but clean and well maintained staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals on time arrival baggage quite slow a good flight overall, decent flight and airplane non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight flight on 18th june-2022 from vancouver to london airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours we received a 10 cad voucher for some drinks this was appreciated because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to amsterdam (from london) within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the british airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards amsterdam when we left the airplane in london there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line we asked around towards the nice employees british airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to amsterdam so we had to wait and be patient after 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat  at some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight this flight was about to leave tuesday morning (it was sunday 5pm when we arrived in london) this meant we have to spent 2 additional days in london before we were able to fly to the netherlands we have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the netherlands and save the receipts and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel food transport) and a refund on the flight for tuesday as we where not going to take this flight they released out baggage gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the tuesday flight they gave us we were going to make our own travel back to the netherlands seems british airways claims & refund process is non responsive as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation but received nothing yet apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight, routine typical ba domestic shuttle flight nothing special departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a 30 minute delay crew were attentive and charming usual clean cut ba product that when it works well is fine, flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down luggage never made it to toronto and we filed a lost baggage report within 24 hours our luggage arrived in toronto and a wonderful ba representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me would definitely give ba a 5 star rating and have them again, check in and security at lhr efficient went to galleries north which was busy but fine with good service left from b gates efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus this was my first time on the club suite travelling with 2 children ba moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in it was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy i liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product the entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned the menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable prior to covid one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back as it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but i doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out the club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly it was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it the second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which i thought was quite good on time arrival prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly we don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise overall a good flight, today my husband and a friend flew from dublin to london city airport all apparently went well from check-in through the flight after that the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom we waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage but neither my husband's nor mine came i found a ba service person to \"help\" me he told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane  i thought one of our bags made it then two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they too had not gotten their bags so i assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction i was then told to file a claim on bacom which we did at this time about 10 hours after our flight landed the system says they have no idea where our bags are now i've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (i usually fly united airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - eg \"your bag was loaded onto the plane\"; \"your bag is on its way to baggage claim\") ba doesn't seem to have anything like this in this case again it appears ba cannot even locate the bag i hadn't flown ba in many years and with experience i would never book them again, british airways is poorly staffed at venice airport no one to check in 2 flights departing within 15 minutes of each other 15 hours before huge line snaking through airport flight crew fine london to baltimore segment on an older 787 usually they are much nicer limited tv and movie selections wifi did not work flight crew ok food adequate, ba cancelled my flight i never got on it couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees  i was booked onto a flight with ba for april 29th 2022 from hong kong to london they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date; covid ticketing flexibility assurances couldn't find a flight up to and including october so i opted for the refund thinking i'd get a full refund i was refunded about 1/5 of what i paid i called their service centre for an explanation as i couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight not have any other flights available and i didn't get a full refund each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service and thats where the frustration begins the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case a month later and about 6 phone calls later thats 6 hours waiting on the phone they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what i paid it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website  just for an answer as to why i wasn't getting a full refund i didn't cancel my booking neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk after another month of waiting  this is the reason they gave in an email \"thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation we're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on 29 april 2022 your claim's been refused because ba0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason further to your request i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund as the same is looked after by our support team we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule thanks again for following this up with us please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon best regards british airways customer relations\" i don't know what \"non payable commercial reason\" is i am out about 250 sterling going to just leave it their and boycott this company, belfast to london on 20 jun 0650 i was informed at about 0200 flight ba1427 has been delayed to 0915 will only reach london heathrow at 1025 i reached the airport at 0445 but ba counter was only open at 0510 at checkin counter i approached ba ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at 1125 on the same day the reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline there’s nothing we can do” i was given a card with contact info on ba customer service and sales for the next 2 hrs in the airport i have been trying to contact ba but was told that hotline only operates from 0800 i have to called another number for “urgent cases” which ever number i dial i just couldn’t get to speak to any one till 0757 again i was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines onboard the aircraft when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment i was told that it’s the customer’s responsibility to do it on their own  i would think twice to take ba in the future, ba is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers seat does not recline legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 160m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can good old times of being a glamour flying ba has far gone ground force almost reduced to 0 only a very cheap pack of crispy and water the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy or well pretending at least for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative you pay extra for absolutely nothing, as a regular ba customer on european flights it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure 45 mins later 4 late customers were allowed to board and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew the benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers sadly ba is in a time warp over this ba pilots used to be some of the best for updating status but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years the food standards and choices in the t5 first lounge are one of the items that have been improved post covid inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in club europe only 4 salad options were available no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers it appears there is no supply control in place at ba food quality was okay but while do&co supply this the do&co meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ba manages (i flew turkish 10 days ago) staff service was perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin i end where i started ba standards continue to slip, i could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing this was a risk i was well aware about when travelling to greece for my wedding however in my many attempts to receive communication from this company it has been nothing but disappointment and upset the company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband the most recent time i have called them is because i requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if i don’t” after this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in edmonton with westjet and that this was “not his problem” before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold i did not book with westjet/nor is this westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when i have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone) i will never use this company again nor will anyone that i am close to this has been completely disheartening please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication i have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before, feels like ba are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy' very pleasant friendly and helpful cabin crew however it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 740pm flight a single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service and with the food you were offered wine only but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water i drank wine anyway but i wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food i've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (i flew westjet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded then brought them to you before and then with your meal in glassware - brilliant air new zealand do glass and use your name throughout) water eventually came round after we'd eaten as i say the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped under-staffed or following poor procedures food was forgettable in-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default not fun on a night flight with turbulence loos on this gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back the upside to this layout is that pe is next to the exit so we deplaned very quickly check-in queue at cancun took forever couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate grateful for priority boarding in this situation bags arrived ok at gatwick no delay i continue to avoid ba unless using avios for business class or where there is no alternative ba's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point, the crew ba656 on 6 june absolutely made this flight smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew i've ever had rebooking for september we were that impressed, i travelled on the 11th april with my baby in economy class flight ba 2260 and ba 2508 i had the pleasure of meeting sarah air stewardess she was absolutely amazing i received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond it was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated she repeatedly asked if i needed anything as i had arham in my lap most of the time she held him whilst i had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft we had a chat and the service was just amazing it is something i will never forget thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight i have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated hope you see this, outstanding inflight service from the crew friendly professional and helpful the very best of british even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at vancouver it didn’t matter the crew made the flight outstanding, recent trip to boston departing lhr t5 ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirements in the us they were really friendly and personable very short queues for bag drop and security i would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the ife box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other the cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy the food by do&co was exceptional i don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-atlantic flight in economy it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station overall it was a great flight helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere i would definitely consider flying with them again, my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively the flight was very expensive though as we booked late after being dumped by air canada / swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment, ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative 8 hours after booking i need to change my flight i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will - that was apparently a lie they actually give me a voucher to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week  i am panicked so i try calling them of course calling them does nothing the hotline says that they are too busy this happens again and again so i give up submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing luckily it shows up quickly and i rebook then i need to change my booking again i go to request a voucher again this time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when i enter it so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher finally i call the executive class phone line (which i am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me they do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours, i have been battling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in 2019 the flight was cancelled a voucher was issued another flight was booked using this voucher and then again cancelled after trying to use the voucher for a new flight ba kept advising i couldn't as the voucher had been used i asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information two years in i managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record i then decided to pursue a refund as felt this would be less problematic ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund one phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days i then chased when it was long overdue i was then told it will be with me in 21 working days the refund never came i try regularly to get through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agents are available i have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me requesting an update but with no response honestly feel very let down by ba who up until this i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now, this flight was not affected by recent problems with ba and i was quite impressed by the british airways premium economy product in a new boeing 787 overall premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class also the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing 787 than in the old b747 or even than in the b777 seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room food service and entertainment options were good clearly worth the extra money for premium economy, british airways continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers the most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company even as part of the executive club (silver) i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust, on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight back to lax i saw the $116 come out of my account the next day as i’m adding in my booking the day before my flight the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to someone else i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them on twitter i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding they just left my message unread after about 6 hours of waiting for a twitter dm back i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british airways app and was unable to find it i would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once i refreshed the page but it did not i continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time say it was a success then never add the booking i’m not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again i’m extremely frustrated, amazing flight and comfortable the premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest new aircraft staff very friendly and professional the food was great beyond expectation, we are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the uk and have had all 4 flights with british airways our 2 internal flights between london and edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications however the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare our initial flight from cape town to heathrow was a full flight the staff seemed very overwhelmed they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the \"leftovers\" my entertainment system was also not working we are about to board the return flight from heathrow to cape town and the check in process was horrific i had booked through expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which i didn't realise until we checked in i ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and i also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the ba customer service number with no luck we asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main ba terminal  overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members none of which could help me there was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend i am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag i was told it was overweight as i was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg compared to having flown with other airlines i will never fly with ba again the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect, i would like to thank you for the great service i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying alone and had a layover in london of a few hours i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight, i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service british airways short haul business class was in a totally different class the cabin had 10 rows of seats in bc a record for me the staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent the food was first class nothing was too much for the staff why oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company british airways keep up the good work (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your european competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a brit, we flew from dubrovnik to heathrow on the 24th april 2022 check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious when boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services choice of 3 main meal options which was very good served by very friendly crew the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at heathrow slightly early overall a very pleasant trip we will be flying again with british airways, my first time in the new club world suite excellent lots of space and privacy very good seat i doubt if this can be bettered good staff as ever my only quibble is that the food is all served at once ba needs to roll this out quickly, i had an incredible rude check in staff at the british airways counter in nice on 16th april 2022 zero empathy towards me a struggling customer second situation happened when we arrived into nice terminal 1 on ba0262 13 april where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery when our luggage arrived at nice airport the day after and received an email from the avia partner lost and found (british airways partner) at 13:14pm informing us that our luggage has now arrived in nice after multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that i did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in monaco it was vital we received the luggage asap the lady replied “if it is so important why don’t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning this has been an appalling experience, we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london as qantas fly to heathrow british airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ba from heathrow to glasgow we booked this flight in october however 2 days before we were due to leave we received an email from british airways advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled to help us out the email said they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport which is 26 miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh not glasgow not sure how we were supposed to get from glasgow additionally it is in economy not business class even though we had booked business class originally we booked this as one connecting flight so british airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from australia there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for british airways they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number their office was closed i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly british airways again, the service was very good the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size the seat was comfortable for economy and because the a380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor there was a lot of space the food was good for airplane food the only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn't good quality however there was a large selection of movies and tv shows, shout out to the help desk at heathrow we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady (with 32 years exp) was great she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay food to eat and a flight home the next day, the short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across as we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the \"points game\" but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats the points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us this status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure when they were still available rather than the 24 hours when they were not available on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she would check nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat judging by the interaction between them i would bet it was someone on staff travel i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it in summary would i ever fly with ba again no not if i had half a chance of going with another airline, a very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good food crew was wonderful new seat is great except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable entertainment great wifi was annoying cutting off and needing constant reconnecting generally a positive experience, ba is getting a real bashing on this forum and i thought i'd buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba8703 this monday easy check in decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers very clean plane which left on time ridiculous amount of legroom in 2d (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1a or c) reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled what's not to like which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experiences over the last 25 years anyway i thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once, new club suites are amazing the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow i have ever used food was ok as i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok the cabin crew were brilliant but i was surprised that after dinner the crew didn’t once come round with beverages or even bottled water ba really have a great hard product here and i would suspect the soft product will improve once covid restrictions become less of an issue well done ba, very small plane for a busy route service was good but food not so ran out of a lot and options left were not good cabin crew for ba actually really friendly, flew back on ba0254 bridgetown to heathrow in the old club class a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough even tried to pay ba's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead my wife and i were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13e and f good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often the march film selection so not good not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though ba's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie london) sort it out ba took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire my wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful as usual when ba is good it's really good but when it's bad it's awful i recommend hesitatingly - come on ba be great again we pay a lot for \"premium\" seats, first the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (zrh-lhr gva-lhr & lhr-zrh) first 2 in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrh-lhr impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gva-lhr 25hrs late as no-one at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhr-zrh 50mins late due to slow gate staff even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass there are more examples and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard 10/10 getting to be onboard 1/10, have not flown economy with ba for years what a shock hard uncomfortable seats small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment food and service appalling 13hr plus flight no socks eye shades ear plug amenity pack and no antibacterial wipes offered wi-fi advertised but not available on flight paid premium money for a budget airline more akin to easy jet ryanair or jetstar my last time travelling with ba after more than 18 years of flying with them ba you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be, flew to barbados 16 march on ba 255 in the new club class suite a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way back comfortable big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphones plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private nice friendly fa's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system thank goodness the latest james bond movie was showing took off and landed on time smooth flight only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat come on ba stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege i recommend with the usual caveats, very poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 600 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this was no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming in the event take off was permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice was available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin time was when flying in business class was real treat no longer is this the case, flew ba lhr-aus on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the a350-1000 on the return leg seats comfortable staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing safety briefing was missed on lhr-aus route lhr-aus boarding on time flight flew out on time landed on time aus-lhr boarding one hour late left an hour late and landed one hour late too food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs in flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working on return leg worked fine but this is due to the a350-1000 being brand new good quality of sleep on both legs which was good check in at lhr was flawless and without incident check in at aus was rotten we queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in what was clear is staff quality in austin is poor passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / verifly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it baggage was received fine at aus and lhr - the latter took ages on return if i had the option of another airline - i would not fly ba, i really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore was closed so they’re using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in suffice to say it was not pleasant onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slippers the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean it’s first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu most of the food was awful my steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing was the constant galley noise there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1k) which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so we’re in and out of that as well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally i’m happy in club and would never do first again, we will never use ba again for a long haul flight our experience of the flight from lhr-mle wasn’t too bad apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience we weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight i think the crew in premium economy were very young and not very experienced leaving the experienced ones in business/first actually i think ba only care about the business/first customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes they ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin) ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen we weren’t fed until 15hrs before we landed (it was a 115hr flight) and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato ba just don’t care anymore about the little people, there was a mistake on my booking made by ba got an email to say \"contact us to discuss\" took over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolved absolutely the most shambolic customer support i have ever experienced still waiting for the call back i was promised 2 weeks ago, the economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight with only about 30 passengers but business class was three-quarters full boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule sadly ba59 makes use of the old club world product which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba42/43 there are some good points about the old club world - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those it's an embarrassment the tiny poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current overly cautious post-covid requirements with everything served at the same time this does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to ba's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean arrival was on schedule but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage, british airways continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full 3x3 seats because of it issue the day before even if weren’t the seat pitch and width is the same as economy gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food was dreadful the in flight service was unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they don’t any more other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around 5 years ago how i used to look forward to it the small gestures like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful, outstanding from the warm smiling welcome on board this flight was excellent the in flight crew were friendly attentive and very professional detailed announcements from the flight deck as well food and wine all very good indeed the premium economy product on ba is also very good comfortable seats foot and leg rests and decent recline fr superior to any other airline on other atlantic routes, check in at iad was quick and easy lounge in washington was a ba lounge and very good sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight flight on time and boarded promptly as we had eaten we opted to sleep there was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it we slept well on time arrival and quickly made it to t5 arrivals lounge which was excellent, ba got everything right allowed evening before check in  this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the us on the day of travel it was half term and the airport busy in spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes lounge clean staff proactive and food served quickly good range of drinks easy transfer to c gates aircraft ready boarding quick and well organised pre departure drinks served the cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service the food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained on time arrival baggage off very fast overall an excellent flight and it feels like ba are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use covid as an excuse for service cut backs well done, this past november/december i flew washington-london return and on the strength of that trip (my first in two years) the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre-pandemic status quo ante the cabin was clean and well maintained seats were comfortable food and drinks were good (including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg) and the ba cabin crews remain the best in the business this was one of a number of bookings that i had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations and contrary to the experience of many here my re-bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly (although i did have a number of lengthy waits on hold but under the present circumstances that's to be expected) it's good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time and i'm looking forward to future trips on ba, i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline our initial flight to dubai was canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute i found that booking with them was extremely simple unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure i called the customer service waited about 20 minutes before i could speak with someone and within 15 minutes the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund the person on the line was extremely nice understanding and willing to help us i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline i got the full refund on my credit card the day after i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on i’ll definitely make sure to check with british airways first, ba cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later we had no issue with this just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible however they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from lhr and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at atl the aircraft was newish and in excellent condition flight was around 50% capacity service was excellent staff were friendly and efficient dinner was good breakfast was disappointing with little choice the lhr to bhd leg was equally good and i am beginning to think that ba are getting their mojo back again, boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate the club suite cabins were about 3/4 full but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off which is a real bonus on a night-time flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive the new seats don't significantly aid sleeping particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons overall a good flight, i used british airways for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service firstly i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage my flight was 16:10 however due to unforeseen circumstances i arrived at the airport around 15:40 i was convinced that i was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long i stood there a few minutes but then realized that i would miss my flight i went to \"club check-in\" and the lady was incredibly kind to me i just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though i was at fault she weighed my luggage and i was able to board the flight successfully i was not aware that this airline gives out free meals we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future unfortunately diversity; the first time i flew was in 2018 and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british airways it was different  the staff was very kind and friendly as well what a wonderful experience to fly with these guys, i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as i’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service i understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but ba’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted enormous queues at jfk ba check-in terminal 7 even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights terrible efficiency at the check-in counters at times only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phones or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in the interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like i’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days, the entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline, straightforward and friendly baggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 15m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our bags on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around menu was basic with no eggs hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins ordered a frittata as was so hungry made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the doors cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didn’t with no apologies or even trying portions were small plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished chocolates are lindor nothing special about the other amenities toilets were no different to what you’d expect amenity kit was basic duvet seemed well used it was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claims of world class standards, on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the check-in desks luggage drop and check-in was appalling it took us over 15 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue) the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one check-in desk for euro traveller / club europe one for bag drop and one for the check-in  flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport, after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats (1k and 2k) to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be back, i paid $1189 for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me i'd be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods phone website twitter and finally email they told me i'd be getting $22916 back which is less than half of the $589 i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded $1458 i emailed again and they told me i'd be getting $11516 more back when i emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with \"that's the final amount\" turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $1458 and i was only getting $11516 total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me, very nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing + i think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes domestic t5 arrivals is a breeze, overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice (much better than when i travelled last time) although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23c) and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at air france) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row 1 in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch) the crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of well-presented however simpler meals on board; to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here (in comparison on a cdg-lhr leg air france presented a ‘chic’ cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising / klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box) one big drawback was the first wing experience at t5: the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead it’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl transfer to kirkwall) which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the money, flying during covid is always a challenge ba’s verifly app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless the bags drop at t5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drinks before lunch was served with more drinks with the meal the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it was only economy but after 8 hours flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed, flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge was good food and drink choices very good first cabin on 787 is 8 seats comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top banana food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba, we've just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared the wines were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet heathrow was a nightmare as often happens being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate then a 25 hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid times, british airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the 7am flight from t5 at heathrow to paris cdg on 22nd november which was boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight was okay this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flights their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk, arrived at the south airport in tenerife 2 hours before departure iberia had not opened the check in even with a full flight waiting the usual check in process post covid took place with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate not sure why the plane was a very new a321 neo with 14 rows of club seating the seat was ok for a 4 hour flight but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front food and drink where very good served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers good selection of wine to go with a above average salad overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew, flew club europe london - tenerife south 5 november and returned 12 november club europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit for the fare i would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference we did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service however on the inbound ba had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes back to the flights: both in a new or nearly near a320 both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect not a good check in experience at tenerife south - just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue also not a great lounge - the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two i would only just about recommend - there are still reservations about exactly what ba is trying to become, i have been trying to get a hold of ba to change my return flight for the past week now i cant change online because i'm flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online i've tried live chat several times and waited 25 hours only to be told there's no one available (during business hours) i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end customer service is non existent however of course if you call the \"new booking\" line someone immediately picks up of course however they can't help me nor put me through to anyone apparently shambolic excuse of an airline that doesn't deserve to be a national airline i haven't had these problems at all and i've been flying throughout covid (for work unfortunately) it's been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i don't even speak spanish, poorly mismanaged services this time disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around 15 hours just to check in then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for 15-30 mins finally when we thought things are better now on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned around 15-20 passengers including me had to wait from 745 am until 140 am for the next flight on boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba, currently dreading my flight with ba considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called “live chat” all we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me we just wanted to be able to make a name change absolutely impossible their website is unusable their customer service is a shambles they couldn’t change the name told me that we should’ve done the booking more carefully well you’re going to have these people making mistakes so maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights like hello it’s the 21st century you should have a button saying “change name” anyways not the point the woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn’t making it clear on what to do then when i gave up towards the end of the call i just said “thanks for your help i’ll deal with it la-“ got cut off 50 minutes and got nothing all i can say is good luck, another ba shuttle flight and a good one fantastic flying weather and i would say a 40% load factor good professional crew friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries and getting to the a gates at t5 makes for an easy exit still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery, flight from larnaca to lhr check in was ok the lounge was an aspire lounge and shared it was basic but ok flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route there were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this a321 service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered it’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware not really interested if i’m being honest when we’ve paid a lot of money for it staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be club europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer the seats are not so comfortable not dreadful but something for ba to think about, upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day 2 test and the check in agent denied us boarding causing my wife who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the uk much distress he was only doing his job of course but we requested him to call a supervisor the check in manager goncalo ribeiro came to our rescue  not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day 2 test uploading it onto our plf’s verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check-in he was at the gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey; we could not have asked for better service he was a very professional ambassador for ba, club europe on british airways outstanding and wonderful to have ba back the welcome on board was warm and sincere flight attendants helpful friendly and professional great updates from the flight deck super lunch and good choice of wines ba at its best hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz, usual ba economy trip pleasant crew complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft very cramped seating and uncomfortable the armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward i have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me other than that ba still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced this time it was good value, check in was easy security quick lounge fine lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed (which was great) flight was fine my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree there was nothing bad about food but nothing great either drinks were fine and proactively served on arrival efficient pcr testing where it was needed and fast turnaround baggage off quick, i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it was an absolute delight on both inward and outward journeys i was impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who was absolute joy and a credit to british airways i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much, the plane was clean and air quality very good timing was perfect i was seated in 15 k to begin with  i had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat when i requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started i was told that tea would be served after dinner i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened at dinner there was no tea service i did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea  there was no hand soap in the washroom however on my way to london from toronto my experience was a good one however it was not the same on my return flight, the service was excellent the cabin staff were attentive and efficient the food and drinks were very good the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice overall a very enjoyable flight, lca to lhr in club europe quick check-in at lca with speedy passport control and security aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink boarding by group and pushback on time ce stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore onboard w-fi was adequate if rather slow and it shouldn't be charged for in business class arrival ahead of schedule disembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly overall a flight that was typical of the post-covid standard for short-haul business class, the crew at denver airport is top notch so impressed with their customer service they were very patient and courteous thank you all for being amazing, an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the govuk website or risk prosecution some people challenged this statement and were rebuked ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice some people were anxious departing the aircraft other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch sky cafe still not on sale - not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england, the service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy the flight down from london i was in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i can’t give you the bottle only a glass however the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3 i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run out the crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair we got diverted as volcano ash was impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria 20 mins from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga we got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 750 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach i have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast, very pleasant flight to lisbon it was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft however in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big club class cabin friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers late breakfast/brunch served was tasty what a contrast to the iberia crew (lisbon/madrid/london) who were cold and unprofessional, stranded in the lounge because i wasn't allocated a seat this for a flight that i booked months ago i didn't want to use them but was forced to because emirates wasn't available i advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options, the entertainment system was working badly the screen was freezing every time i wanted to open flight map though the aircraft was 8 years only the window blinds worked with delays the crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a short-haul flight after flying with aeroflot and s7 airlines i expected to receive an excellent ba service but i got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water i think it’s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this i can get that hot meals on board are now rare i loved the most comfortable seats in my life i tend to have problems with sleeping on board but this time i didn’t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff, i flew on british airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23kg each the value for money here is incredible the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water there was wifi onboard which we paid £1199 for the full flight access package and it was great it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands, very efficient evening bag drop security quick galleries north lounge was very good food and drinks fine plane left on time pre ordered door was ok early arrival fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early, ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your check-in this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff don’t seem to want this they want to see the actual forms tests etc this wasted about 40 minutes and is pointless the return flight again had no access to the club lounge you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again (last 2 flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience) on board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to ryanair on board food was very good for a short haul flight, check in well organised no lounge in cancun efficient boarding process given water bottle before take off no welcome drink now covid rules are being relaxed this needs to change menu good and food acceptable staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience managed to sleep a few hours for the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly this may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into gatwick at that time, departure lgw north so aspire lounge bag from fine lounge basic on time departure cabin crew welcoming but only given menu water and amenity pack looks like some of white company bedding options removed lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service not complete return to old days but getting there flight generally good early touch down club world luggage off last which meant a wait of 75 minutes for luggage, the airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover in london and my only option was to book the next flight that has a 7-8 hours layover that's before i board the flight to toronto while i understand schedule changes and do my best to stay positive and supportive i contacted the airline asking for upgrades to a best seat i asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport they denied my ask no explanations and no empathy not only that but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation again not the change in schedule not the extra 5 hours layover time just the way they chose to treat a customer who didn't do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute, aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check-in and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient although admittedly it’s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present it was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms thanks to just 30 passengers on board with more than half in club europe the flight took off ahead of time service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class with too much pre-packaging - the covid effect presumably arrival into t5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control we were through the e-gates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing, i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze after frustratingly missing my flight due to m25 road closures she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges i am really grateful, after sixteen months of being grounded by covid it felt almost surreal to be back in t5 heading for what to us was essential summer sun in greece t5 was blissfully quiet with no queues at check-in or security and even the galleries south lounge was less frenetic than usual despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape boris johnson’s bully boy attitude ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets the flights was very quiet with just 30 pax on board 9 of whom were in club europe boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’ service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual do&co quality landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form overall a thoroughly reassuring coming out of covid experience, fantastic flight down to heathrow crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water it’s a start, boarding and disembarking were greatly organised: passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows from the backside to the front (business) minimizing the possiblity for jamming same at disembarking: passengers were asked to remain seated then row per row was called crew members were supporting the process what could be improved: distribute hand-sanitizer during boarding when snack was distributed my row (#8 business) was overlooked for some reason; after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food - staff was surprised and fixed it this was my first flight since one year and i appreciated the covid measures taken by ba - still it left some strange experience, this was not my best experience with ba thus far as there were a couple of disappointments i was happy with the fast baggage check-in this was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline the covid protocols are not as robust as they should be particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance there was a big mix up which i find inexcusable - i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but i don't expect such at this level bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome the plane arrived 10 minutes late, i had travelled to india for an eye surgery on my flight back to london heathrow i was assisted by a member of the cabin crew madeline thomas she was an amazing person as she made sure i was feeling okay as i had come back from my surgery and was traveling by myself she was more then a nurse and took care of my needs like a mom she also made sure i had eaten my food and stood by next to me as i was feeling awful because i was in lot of pain, charge £700 fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance absolutely disgraceful their site says £30 fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page 27 of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount  i received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative, good service the whole way nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight plane was clean and refreshments were provided my only issue is that the flight was packed - understandable as it was just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the masks my return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time also wi-fi did not work i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic i'm sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant value for money marked down only because the christmas flights were so expensive to be expected though i know, i entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that i should have felt obliged to bring the flowers when she realized that i was going to my mother's funeral with the flowers she was apologetic (she had no idea why i was bringing in flowers) but the crew were very nice to me during this flight, i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the 23rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldn’t get home i’ve also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british airways starting from testing (because egypt requires tests) as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding (i’m not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this) the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee - shanell (if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5) she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba check-in but unfortunately couldn’t do it as my results didn’t go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive i’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated (i will spare the details) however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady i’ve ever met unfortunately i didn’t catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i can’t thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady (shame i don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i haven’t met them i don’t know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no one in, this is my first flight since january we have had three cancellations which ba handled superbly but this flight went ahead check in at lhr was fine no fast track se unity at t5 galleries south lounge open they have an app system it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly followed this with a shower (they are open-limited hours) flight on time and well presented a321 staff worked hard nice drinks run the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times landed on time priority baggage cane off late overall happy with product and would use again, overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines i had to call ba a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and i would rate their customer service 10/10 everyone i talked to was extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines i was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge they have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in 2020 the flight itself was fine and i appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea the one thing - which i mean as constructive criticism though - i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports the arrival sheets for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in italy when i asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in venice that's fine on the first day after (yet another) update but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day i travelled overall my experience with ba was very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service i received, i am extremely pleased with british airways as they refunded my tickets munich-london city-munich within 2 working days in a friendly and professional manner: the difference between british airways and lufthansa is night and day friendly professional and prompt are 3 adjectives to describe ba while lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant impossible to contact and ignorant well done and best wishes to all at british airways, boarding and checkin formalities are very nice check in help desk was very helpful and supportive everything was nice except food i am vegan and there was no food availability for vegetarian passengers if not pre-ordered my flight was 10 hour journey from london to bangalore and i was hungry, i have always had great flights with british airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing as this was my 100th flight i decided to celebrate it in club europe which turned out to be a perfect decision the stewards working in club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight other features didn’t let me down either efficient business class check in at warsaw cosy executive lounge preludium with attentive and helpful staff well organised boarding (although no priority for club europe because of corona) the aircraft was very fresh and clean seats were comfortable with enough legroom adjustable headrests and power ports the on board service is different than before corona times but it’s still very good tasty lunch box from do&co with fresh chicken sandwich oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse the choice of drinks was wide including a very good quality champagne from nicolas feuillatte all in all a perfect flight experience with british airways everything i expected from this flight was fulfilled the one thing i can complain about is baggage handling at heathrow we waited around 50 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of club europe priority, newcastle to london heathrow with british airways i was pleasantly surprised plane was on time and spotlessly clean professional staff; bottle of water crackers and crisps handed out lovely deplaning with special covid social distancing system working well, due to the coronavirus situation i bought a return ticket back to my home country (singapore) from london (where i currently reside) because the first wave of asia in march was done i was due to fly back to london on 25th august 2020 and my flight got cancelled before my flight cancellation i got an email from the airline that i could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled so i applied for an online voucher but i was told that i am not eligible to get a voucher because i have done the london to singapore leg a month later i tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow i was successful but to redeem the voucher i have to call to redeem the voucher (which i think it is a complete joke) and i was put on hold for many hours, a short hop from london to edinburgh in november 2019 - efficient clean and punctual the airport experience was straightforward and i think flying from city you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable i got my luggage quickly at the other end and i appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from, total rip off british airways cancels flights due to pandemic covid 19 when i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional $1000 for a first class seat british airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic, london heathrow to toronto my wife and i used avios and the ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday i was also excited to fly on an a350 for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations the breakfast buffet in the ba lounge in heathrow t5 was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees the aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting very comfortable spacious seats and large high-resolution ife screens i like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available we both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew the a350 is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the 747 and 777, my wife and i used avios and my ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon the check-in and security were very efficient and the lounge (not belonging to ba) was clean but had a more limited range of food than i would have expected boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional i am a big fan of the iconic 747 but we flew out on one of ba's new a350's and this brought home to me that the 747 business class is looking tired and old in comparison the seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality ife screen was behind the times however it was a night flight so i slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tail-winds, london-heathrow to warsaw on 14th march british airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience starting from check in and ending on the deplaning very friendly smiling chatty people throughout my journey including the lovely captain who gave all the information about delay missed slot and new departure time what is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here the boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially i didn't try the paid marks&spencer on board service but i think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free the one thing i can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean the toilet was filthy, just before the borders were closed in south africa due to corona virus i went to the airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned there was no international flight customer service staff available so i was not able to get a response the only number available was a uk number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire next day i managed to get on board the flight sadly due to my fault i forgot my laptop inside the aircraft on arrival to terminal 5 i was one of the last passengers to leave the plane i realised my mistake after i passed security and i was not allowed back into the airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and i understand why i could not go back to the aircraft they gave me a number to call and i have been calling the number since march so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items basically ba does not have means in place for passengers to find their items my laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence i just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane lessons learned avoid if you can, i flew to vancouver mid march to see my mother then in hospital three days after arrival my mother passed away and i subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral i tried to manage my booking online as ba suggest but because i had bought a package that included car hire the ba site said i was unable to change this online and i had to call their customer services i spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online  i set up conversations facebook and twitter they went unanswered on the second day of my telephone ordeal i actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays’ who said he couldn’t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line when this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting i managed to blurt out my ref number nothing else… before that call was disconnected thankfully the one person i had briefly spoken to in the duty office that night then emailed me back and i was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight this change took about 10-15 minutes over a few emails but the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected the only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company but two days previously when i tried to manage my booking online i was told i couldn’t do this because i had bought a package and that this could only be done by ba i do totally understand the turmoil caused by covid-19 but never again ba, i booked my flights to the uk in may 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march 12 2020  4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on march 16 2020 and because i am older and have pre-existing health conditions my doctor asked me to postpone our trip the british airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable now the problem is i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may 2020 for travel to the uk by may 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip how can i make travel arrangements by may 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place i understand ba has policies in place but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid-19 i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline my preferred airline is still british airways british airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisisand make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers remember there are many other airlines out there to choose from the coronavirus is something that no one has any control of i guess the bottom line is i think british airways needs to put some common sense to their policy i want to rebook and travel but i am hesitant to this at this time hopefully may 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us, mumbai to london heathrow i wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flight someone had erroneously accused me of being on a flight from goa to mumbai and coughing throughout the journey categorically i was not on that flight but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when i repeatedly said so the stewards dealt with this situation with tact absolute professionalism and great courtesy all the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment they are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can get home safely and i wish to thank our crew in particular for what they did, i have a booking for march 19th london heathrow to valencia and ba still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund option the ba website was updated on 17 march to state \"we’re working closely with the foreign & commonwealth office (fco) to continue flying where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so\" i then checked the fco website that was also updated on 17 march and it states: \"the foreign and commonwealth office (fco) advises against all but essential travel to spain\" so it is clear that ba deem it \"safe\" to fly to spain despite the fco statement i know the airline is suffering like the rest of uk industry and business but how can they get away with such deceitful practices it is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds and are not complying with the british fco advisory is this actually legal, diabolical that british airways are still forcing people to fly to madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the foreign office have advised against anything other than essential travel what a way to treat their customers if that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble, london to paris return group booking cancelled i know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline but ba appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it is proving impossible to speak with them after the constant it debacles this airline has surely it is time for heads at the top to roll cancelled my booking for flight refund online but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards however the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information a 5 year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that ba currently has and my patience of being loyal to ba (for over 40 years i might add) has run out the management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line, london to beijing in january 2020 ba has really upped their game now a few years back i took ba the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since however my recent flight is good the flight was delayed for 1 hour due to mechanical reasons but get back majority of the delay in the air food is tasty and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry the drinks are offered in the promote manner and crews are really willing to engage with you (in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep) seat is a bit tight but understood i am flying economy so this is bearable the return flight has been cancelled it takes like 10 calls / emails and they finally sorted out our flight this could be improved but i appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not ba's partner overall ba has really improved the game and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world, hong kong to london great airline indeed staff were friendly and helpful the aircraft was very clean the crews are diverse will definitely fly again, mumbai to london the check in process was quick efficient and friendly unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure but ba kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court information explanation and apology over the delay was given by the first officer which we were happy with the entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually worked good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though very happy with the service, london to delhi this booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to bag drop according to the check in screen all zones were applicable for our destination but we were sent from one zone to the next; (which given the size of the t5 check in hall wasn't helpful) eventually we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude - especially when we discovered we were seated separately; it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats fortunately the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight with great service and positive friendly attitude i actually praised them and told them that my faith in ba had been restored, vancouver to london there are time when british airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriers this flight proves the point from the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at lhr the crew were outstanding friendly attentive and professional the dinner was excellent excellent choices on the menu accompanied by some decent wines i had a painful back from running a flight attendant provided some medication came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when i deplaned very thoughtful seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket ife good the b747-400 is showing its age but it’s still a wonderful iconic aircraft to fly on and i’ll continue to prefer it over the b777, mexico city to manchester via london my plane from mexico city to london was smooth entertainment was quite nice and so was the food; although i chose a window seat and was never informed it wasn't actually the window but a wall the crew was amazingly kind and lovely they're always checking on you and we even got a magnum loved this airline for my first flight ever, london heathrow to sofia a good experience onboard one of bas recently refreshed a321 cabins although unfortunately without any in-seat power supply contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get in-seat power following refresh another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the ba product however the flight overall was very good as usual an extremely efficient pre-flight experience at heathrow's excellent t5 fast track security was fast as expected galleries club lounge was pretty good and not too crowded boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual the crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight the food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering i found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a 5 ft 11\" chap so overall a good experience with no major complaints, johannesburg to london whoever designed the refurbished galleries lounge at jnb has no understanding of acoustics as every syllable of a facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience thankfully the upper deck of the a380 was more civilised with an efficient if slightly distant cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff allowing plenty of time for sleep food was mediocre and i've given up expecting anything more from ba's business class product the white company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement and breakfast has become rather perfunctory with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant arrival at a chilly lhr was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing reliability is currently ba's strongest card, las vegas to gatwick a very disappointing service for club world it felt like i was travelling in economy (with attitude) especially considering the very high cost of the flight (i've paid half as much less for business class returns to australia) we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass) my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered when i queried it i got a lecture on this was how it should be no wine arrived with dinner until i asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice) no second glass of wine offered yes i could have used the call button but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight other than the initial bottle of water and a glass of water with dinner no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask the good news is the food was good and well presented although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast) we had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast only to find we were being asked again at breakfast sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high i actually thought i had a fever (i was so drenched in sweat) until i spoke to a colleague who was the same i'm used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines so i'm used to hot cabins but this was crazy only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up) was it bearable enough to sleep combined with the a very dry cabin air it was very unpleasant no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window i do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down being on the second aisle we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark so it wasn't quick at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed but the service was budget airline level really ba you need to do much much better the ground staff in las vegas were fast friendly and efficient the lounge was something from the dark ages all 1970's wooden panels, cape town to johannesburg the slow lounge at cape town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink including ingenious wine-dispensing machines boarding was quick and take-off was exactly on time there was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed the club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule, on 4th of december before my flight's departure i got my purse stolen in nyc with all my money and my passport in it thanks to the kind strangers i managed to get to the danish embassy and get a temporary passport when i arrived at the jfk airport it was too late and i wasn't allowed to drop off my luggage with tears in my eyes i went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful - she booked me on to the next flight for free got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened when i finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as i haven't had any food for the whole day as i didn't have any money i want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that i got back to denmark safely i was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff once again thank you, phoenix to london since moving to the usa i've been flying ba more than in the past and overall they provide a more than acceptable service if you choose your seat in club world carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations the new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting on this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good departed phx early and arrived into lhr early where immigration and baggage took minutes if you manage your expectations with ba then you won't be disappointed with club world, london heathrow to bangkok done this route a few times with british airways over the years first time and probably last in economy old plane needs upgrade poor entertainment system uncomfortable seats especially for 10+ hour flight i know they’re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy, mumbai to boston via london my flight with british airways was really good the catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good however some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the ife box blocking space in front of you also ba had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in they have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead you have to check it in the ground staff was rude at logan airport in boston also they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in boston 24 hrs after i had come even after contacting ba's baggage customer service they were speaking rudely to me they always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern british airways needs to improve their ground experience, toronto to geneva via london i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service apparently things have improved somewhat since so i decided to give them another try overall i was happy with my experience save for two major gripes on the plus side: i flew on new aircraft which were comfortable albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines) legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31\" pilots were very good and informative as always with ba quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; i rather enjoyed the meals served which were on nice large trays the ife was just about adequate though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft cathay pacific's is far superior the two major downsides: 1 the new basic economy fare it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers ba really need to get rid of it virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag so please just include it in all airfare types if i wanted to be nickle-and-dimed i'd fly to gatwick on a charter airline also not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay thankfully the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely 2 no complimentary catering on short-haul seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with ba and have spent at least $1000 on their airfare i resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip if ba would get rid of these two new features i would not hesitate to fly with them again as everything else about my trip was pleasant as it is i would still consider other airlines, hong kong to london heathrow with british airways one of the best flights i’ve had in a premium cabin the service seat food and wine are among the best i’ve experienced the only gripe i had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by ba the cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch i would not hesitate flying first class with ba on my next flight, warsaw to london everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight professional crew with beams on their faces new aircraft (it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in a321neo as those seats are the old type pinnacle seats and have better legroom) very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated) on time landing and good atmosphere on board the food in euro traveller is unfortunately no longer free however being in ba's executive club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios which is very convenient the only drawback i could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at warsaw airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx 200 people is rather not enough, new york  to london heathrow very good staff very nice comfortable seats seat recline good enough food a bit limited i would recommend ba to others since they are a very good airline, london to los angeles take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their control i was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4) sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working and we were sitting into an 115hr overnight flight with two little ones meaning sleeping was not going to happen we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation sorry they said during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around to cap it off we landed at 10pm et and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller we finally received them back 2 days later conclusion never fly ba again, british airways (comair) johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched back 9 rows service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and comair’s idiosyncratic ‘four-course meal’ ie a tiny salad a hot course that one could see before choosing a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering aside from the meal the flight was typically efficient with arrival slightly ahead of schedule, london to johannesburg departure was slightly delayed by 50 mph gusts but once away  the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck seats 53j/k are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet the dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film cabin crew were pleasant and attentive toilets were kept clean throughout the flight arrival was 30 minutes behind time but baggage collection and customs were mercifully quick so we were in the slow lounge just 40 minutes after landing overall a good flight, overall a very comfortable flight with british airways both of my flights took off on time and reached on time i was really excited to fly ba since they changed the aircraft from boeing 777-200 to a boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies  the flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds on my second flight to mumbai the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service however during the lunch service they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian overall my both flights with ba were good there are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of usb ports power outlet old ife the ife box in front of you that blocks your legroom  ba  need to refurbish their old cabins on boeing 777-200 and boeing 747if they still plan to use them on longer flights, fantastic flight travelled solo from london gatwick to glasgow in british airway’s club europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service i arrived at gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure all ba club world passengers are entitled to fast track security at gatwick this was quick and the staff were pleasant enough the lounge at gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early the crew were very attentive and friendly the in-flight meal was delicious (i had smoked salmon served with curried rice) overall a really lovely flying experience had there been ever-so-slightly more leg room and in-flight entertainment i’d have given this flight 10/10 a fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline, rio de janeiro to london heathrow love this aircraft only a 3 class business world traveller plus and economy class 2 cabins in business class front 3 rows and rear 2 rows i had seat 3a in my opinion the seat window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat (at 6'4'' a little extra helps) very private tucked behind second galley area toilet is over the other side j/k i settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately a good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about 10 minutes before breakfast i really enjoyed the fruit yoghurt muesli and the full english breakfast all in all great service good flight and felt fully relaxed, gatwick to tirana i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat to three seats behind me  the seats were the same seats you have in economy the difference being that the middle seat is empty thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats  i encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service flight left on time and landed early british airways have in my opinion the  best inflight w-fi service for 10 pounds you get unlimited very high speed wi-fi where you can stream youtube videos they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts, keflavik to london heathrow cabin crew were amazing weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough expecting a delay and seeing other european flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding snow in blizzard conditions we were surprised but got settled in our seats crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the di-icing machine we finally made our way to take off all the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the ba online app to help them non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time the first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not ba fault that the de-icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take-off how the pilot and team managed this in these conditions i will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to heathrow cabin crew provided excellent service being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely so just want to thank you ba we know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we can't fault you particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us well done, london to hong kong at the entrance to the ba business lounge there was a sign saying silver and gold members only my membership had just dropped to bronze while my wife's remained at silver at the reception desk i asked why bronze wasn't allowed and was only told i could enter as a guest of my wife's when i got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and i can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest no warm greeting just a job's worth high handed attitude neither of the ba reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly had they done so they would have seen that it was a business class ticket and i had the right to enter under my own steam anyway fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer, los angeles to london heathrow if i could give ba a zero stars i would they have the worst customer service i’ve flown many airlines around the world with my family but surely we will never fly with british airways again they gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 45 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight together the flight to london didn’t have the best service most toilets were out of service the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class i’ve flown the check-in process at heathrow was disastrous the most inefficient process with no human assistances the limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers i would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier i wish i would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them, london heathrow to rio de janeiro not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites this aircraft today has a first class but was flown empty as it usually only offers club world flight not full seated in 7f aisle seat no one in the middle seat so very pleasant it is away from the toilet over at 7a/b but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight food (pre-ordered) was very good as usual plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist again nothing any trouble at all i did watch some films but i had already been on a previous ba long haul so was not really looking for much i had some rest as it was a long day and i getting a cold arrived late due to a technical problem at heathrow they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour i must say i didn't really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate all in all another very good flight, budapest to billund return via london on 18 and 28 dec 2019 a320 aircrafts check-in in budapest had a narrow timeslot of 2 hours before departure with long queues i was not recognised as oneworld elite flyer (hold a gold card with qatar airways) at check-in and had to struggle to get 2 bags accepted as inscribed luggage i was denied lounge access as qr does not honour 3rd party lounges any more unless flying on qr there is no oneworld  lounge in budapest so ba uses menzies lounge who would not accept me unless i was with an entitled oneworld card different from qatar airways for ba i do not have status in london granted access to any oneworld lounge onboard food and drinks with hefty price tags  water is not free flights were full but on time i found that the onboard charity collection by fas is inappropriate and intrusive luggage delivered perfectly return trips (2 legs) were both full flights but departed slightly early granted lounge access in billund in the decent king amlet and ba galleries first in t3 in london loads of good hot foods and good beers and wines onboard there is no ife no seat recline mediocre not cheap but the ffp is among the best in oneworld and the gold status of ba is very rewarding, i recently flew from cape town in south africa via london to brussels it was our anniversary and we were treated to a glass of bubbly after take off the staff were so friendly and i cannot even complain about the food served on board which i might add i seldom enjoy food served on flights, sydney to toulouse via singapore / london boeing 777 and ife ancient the comfort and service superb highlight on the tls-lhr sector a (£550) celebratory treat with mince pie christmas cake brandy butter which combined with a g&t hit the spot you could argue it should be free but i’m not complaining  i do miss the ba quality of service but compared to the me airlines you’re still pretty good, sofia to london a good overall experience departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in sofia and complete failure to honour priority boarding flight experience generally good and arrival experience at heathrow very good and efficient, my husband and i had a wonderful flight to barbados the cabin crew were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble josey and her team were made the the journey amazing having flown with virgin for many years i can say it’s night and day tank you your staff are amazing we will be british airways in the future many thanks, new york to london i was on the last flight out at 1135 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects  the boeing 777 certainly showed its age ife screen was tiny seat was well used the flight time was quick (550 hours) and thats about it fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me the f& b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier i'm a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier (usually followed by a drink or two), london to san francisco this flight was a delight friendly relaxed crew good food and wine and a main deck club world cabin that was nearly empty if you manage your expectations with ba club world and everything goes as it should then you shouldn't be disappointed yes the rollout of the new club world suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably - ba are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of \"world's favourite airline\" the 747 has seen better days however given they're being removed from most airline's passenger services you should take the opportunity to fly one before they're gone i'm gradually regaining my confidence in ba, london to singapore i was apprehensive about flying ba club world after reading many negative reviews i was however surprised firstly they are not on part with sq or qr - but to be fair i found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings you get what you pay for the seat while old is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space the window seats are best for privacy i am tall and had no issues sleeping in fact i slept for almost 7 hours the service and food out of london was top notch fresh and plentiful which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on qantas service was consistent polite and very attentive drinks and water continually topped up i was truly impressed the return flight's service was very average and quite sloppy but let’s focus on the positives, london heathrow to stockholm business class short-haul is what it is seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat but you get served drinks and food proper gin for the g&t and good food, johannesburg to london we had limited recline seats on an 11 hour overnight flight at checked in we asked and were told we had good seats completed a complaint and asked why ba thought this was ok how come their representatives are allowed to lie never flying ba again, london heathrow to miami flying the boeing 747-400 unfortunately ba hasn't done much work on their first class on these aircraft seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6'1\" makes the beds small and since it's so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side these seats are business class on for example qatar airways and i still think a first class ticket should include wifi but as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful meals are impeccable, stockholm to london heathrow as always ba works excellent with service on the ground and in the air they still have a good gin aboard for a decent g&t and even if the meals in business looks like the came from the 90's economy they taste great, london to sydney via singapore flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic meals were great leaving london we had a chicken stir fry and landing into singapore at 18:00 we were served an english breakfast which i can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd at singapore all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean when re-boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate we were on the ground in singapore for 1hour 30min 2nd leg to sydney was great also food and drink service was great again 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable we had exit row seating for entire flight which i recommend to anyone over 6ft tall, brussels to bangkok via london club world from london to bangkok on 17 nov 2019 seats 15c and 15d it was a boeing 777 with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin which gives the cabin a crowded impression the seats are comfortable with a flat bed (+mattress) good selection of entertainment although a rather small screen the food menu offers different choices of starters main course and desserts the food was disappointing i had smoked salmon as a starter and british beef as main course my soup was cold mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like the service is very friendly but not personal i’m used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class  while serving the meals they forget serving me wine the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin after dinner i went to sleep the seat is turned into a real bed with an extra mattress and a good pillow the space is narrow it is difficult to make the bed once the bed is made there is no place to put  personal stuff i had a real good night of sleep though if your seat is not at the aisle you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet the toilets are small and simple not cleaned frequently enough when i woke up breakfast service was running  the breakfast is good  yoghurt pastries fresh fruit and a full english breakfast overall british airways world club is a rather standard business class lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience  if ba wants to compete they have a long way to go i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight, i had a connection flight from london to berlin traveling with hand luggage i got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that i need to check my baggage  he has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass if the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage the flight arrived in berlin 7 minutes late, london to johannesburg with british airways ba’s b gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the galleries lounges in the main terminal it’s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the c gates where the a380s depart from the new boarding by groups meant snaking queues but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily the club world were still the same much maligned seats with the small unresponsive ife screens and limited selection of films the dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat trolleys may lack glamour but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight breakfast was adequate but nothing more landing was exactly on time overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average, london to sydney via singapore i would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at heathrow when i lost my passport on thursday evening -21st november they spent nearly 2 hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found 30 mins before my flight was due to leave a big thank you to you all i would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight ba0015-singapore to sydney -22 november who were so kind after i was taken ill during the flight i was looked after so well, lisbon to london i pay extra to check my bag to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space to have british airways charge me 50 euros to check a bag to my final destination and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat in a cramped aircraft to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags is an insult will never fly ba again, doha to london surprisingly good flight ontime departure and early arrival by 30min very very attentive and friendly crew especially towards children food was halal since from doha clearly announced to passengers bag arrival was ok seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation, san francisco to london a380 is a wonderful aeroplane movie selection was below average staff were polite fist time i used the call button mid-flight response was fast but on second occasion i was repeatedly ignored call button for 45 minutes i don’t see how that is acceptable, sydney to singapore with british airways packed in like sardines in a tin can what a disappointment of an airline they pack you in and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration you awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze my seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past (very narrow passage ways) would not and could not recommended this airline these seats are at best premium economy, london to mauritius we are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines without a shadow of a doubt the whole british airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight i truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver i begrudge flying with them and given the option i always choose a different airline, los angeles to amsterdam via london due to delayed take off i risked missing my connecting flight thanks to the excellent premium host service julie and her colleague i managed to be on time thank you very much, london heathrow to lisbon mediocre the flight was very smooth and arrived on time cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions no bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a ‘nudge’ before it was delivered not a great club europe experience, london to boston comfortable flight in economy class food was fairly good both ways - dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east got some solid sleep in on the flight back, tirana to london gatwick i fly british airways around six times a month thanks to my work and while i almost always have a pleasant experience this past flight definitely outdid all the others we boarded and departed exactly on time with a very friendly and welcoming crew while the flight was fully booked my travel companion and i were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat and therefore more space the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wi-fi which i have never had on any other british airways flight within europe in fact the wi-fi package i got which included only texting was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me something that british airways can improve on would be leg space which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight although that is a common problem for me as i am 188 cm tall also for unknown reasons no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight only drinks this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast but i managed well the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly i always recommend ba - and will continue to do so, gatwick to st lucia great service on this flight thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew excellent service, london to singapore i have to commend ba staff on this occasion they were friendly welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness thank you ba for making a long journey a tolerable one, gatwick to venice we have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects on the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service it was welcome and efficient particularly as the gate was a very distant one the flight departed to time the cabin staff were pleasant the food was good in flight information from the flight deck was good the landings were noticeably smooth the return journey was similarly good i was very satisfied, seychelles to london day time flight back to london staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats 7 j/k best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window k seat has direct access to the aisle on-time departure and swift meal services nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment i have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to london the easiest to travel on seat and screens worked great and no problems i loved every minute of the flight a big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic looking forward to my next flight to rio in december, london to belfast british airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion i booked my parents on ba to attend my investiture at the palace my mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and i had chosen ba expecting the best level of service instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff my mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and i booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side i printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d on arrival at check-in one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one on going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed my father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘geneva convention’ that ba are only contracted to get them from a to b and could change seats if they wanted waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances at no stage did they receive any apologetic words for someone recovering from a heart attack this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion i have been holding on with the hope that bas slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed i will await bas response to my parents; i know they will not fly the carrier again but i will be handing back my ba amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued will update in summary don’t trust ba with your loved ones care, london to cape town we had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to africa i usually fly star alliance but picked ba for a segment for better connection timing through london to cape town this was a huge mistake i had tried to reserve seats on ba website twice and was not able to do so then i tried to call ba twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option when we arrived today in london from toronto at the connections desk seven hours before our flight we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy ba’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats we were at the bottom of the list for business class and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us but we would still be welcome in the lounge (as if this was a bonus) then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade) it took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk we asked to speak to a manager but at each of our four interactions with ba staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could at one point i got visibly frustrated after the ba staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary which it definitely was not after two and a half hours ba customer service managers came to speak with us they were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective if british airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight i will not be booking flights on ba again, london heathrow to edinburgh boarding efficient flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage by doing so they would get priority boarding i took up the offer too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the back of the plane - 36 f i am sure ryanair have more room british airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy, flight from gatwick to barbados check in and business lounge were good it looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive breakfast was good flight left on time boarding well run i have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok new configuration but that does come with panasonic ife system which is way better than the old rockwell collins systems food was fine and service friendly, we were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our icelandair flight and rebooked onto ba direct from toronto to london heathrow we tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into gatwick the flight was quite good service was fantastic and the chicken tikka masala was tasty the crew onboard was friendly flight was on time and landing was amazingly smooth, i was travelling from jeddah to london with a bag i arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed i tried my best but there was no staff to help me so i have to leave my bag as i was not allowed to take the bag on the plane in london i made a complaint but they were saying that we can’t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait, zurich to london return both legs travelled with hand luggage only and i could not choose a seat without paying fair enough but when there are 3 empty rows either side of 3 strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least hand luggage fares are last to board make them uncomfortable on board no free food nor drink, san francisco to london efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at $760 per person which we declined refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks boarding on time but could have been better controlled flight left and landed ahead of schedule flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints, london to belfast check in was fast and efficient and using the ba terminal-5 first class check in and security area was really good and i was straight into the lounge great selection of food and drinks early morning i really like the ba boarding process ieby group numbers the onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent overall very happy with this short flight with ba, frankfurt to london flight attendants very kind when flying in return flight was canceled at london city airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking hotel voucher and transportation arranged that could be done far more efficiently no water nothing no necessities, hyderabad to san francisco via london i had an awesome experience with one of customer service representatives at british airways i called them with regards to a reimbursement and was put across a lady named florencia she not only helped gather all details (bank address etc) required for payment but also initiated the payment instantly that was certainly over and beyond what i expected great job your service is exemplary, vancouver to london very poor experience my flight with ba the 2-4-2 business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class one toilet closed (nobody around to repair ) on one point ba even better than asian companies its even more freezing why do we need to freeze in such a 9 hours trip  no staff to answer my question no staff to make it better one good point the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better, london heathrow to seychelles really great flight boarding was very quick the flight was full seats great 07 a/b good inflight entertainment plenty of choices food was good as we already pre-ordered our meals my beef was well done just how i like it after a late 30 minute delay we landed on time into seychelles the crew were very attentive lots of very demanding passengers all in all a good flight after 7 hours of sleep, amman to london this is a nice aircraft with comfortable seats and a very soft landing this aircraft flies from amman airport at 8 am local time and arrives in only 5 hours to london this is a very good product, mexico city to barcelona via london heathrow the b787 is an incredible plane the legroom is quite good the seat is comfortable and the ife has a great number of movies series and music the food is average the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes salad and wine not very tasty the breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms fruit and a muffin it was delicious the cabin crew was ok not bad not excellent we arrived on time and was a great flight on the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice no ife no onboard service it’s almost like a low cost i recommend for long flights but not for european flights, great all round ba2591 11 october good price easy boarding lovely cabin crew great iced coffee on sale comfortable on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing couldn’t ask for more (until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich), flew from london heathrow to abu dhabi honestly they were really good legroom great crew excellent - looked after us superbly food and drinks were bang on did vegas in april too nowt wrong with this airline, dubai to london heathrow i flew on the a350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again on the same multi segment trip i tried sq business class and ek business class (and sadly the old ba business class on an aging b777) on overnight trips the new \"business suite\" offering from ba is the best business class i have experienced i am a ba gold card holder and the experience was outstanding the first lounge at dxb was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue on board the new suite was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in the bed was very comfortable food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight i would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers i don't know but i certainly could work very effectively in my suite downside is the ife is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product, yesterday my husband and i decided to to come home from rome earlier than the scheduled time at 8pm when i rang ba in london the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra onboard the flight the steward gave me hot water and milk so that i can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me while waiting to get off the plane i had a wonderful conversation with the ba staff who are so pleasant i love flying with ba and we will continue to do so we have booked our flight with ba next year thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service, short 45 minute flight north and south with british airways lounge at lhr and also ncl was busy but there was no shortage of seats gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits the seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time, calgary to gothenburg via london with british airways staff are very friendly and helpful entertainment was good food was just ok although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldn't be my first choice to serve the seats are incredibly uncomfortable super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours for a 9 hour flight this is painful paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on recommend for short trips, for a long time i have avoided taking british airways due to it’s poor past reputation yesterday i traveled on ba 34 from kuala lumpur to london heathrow i boarded the flight with an open mind over 12 hours later i disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to it’s customers a praise is due and i want to congratulate ba for such a pleasant experience the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler what more can i say enough to say that i will be traveling with ba again, austin to london another pleasant flight on an ageing 747 after the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger she kindly swapped seats so we could be together for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel you’re in your own little world a good flight on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect, london to kuala lumpur better than i was expecting after reading the other reviews the seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg (less so on the return) a few areas need improvement: 1) separate toilets from economy 2) dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service 3) a better 2nd meal - the main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal (breakfast) was a bit of an afterthought would i choose ba premium eco again : yes definitely, i wish i could give a zero i was booked on a flight from newark to madrid via london i come to find that the minimum layover time in london is 1 hr my flight layover in london was 1hr5min british airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in london were the same but that was a total lie my wife and i were sprinting across the airport but between getting off the aeroplane having to go through security again and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection we missed the layover flight we had the same route in the reverse direction i called ba hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation they kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than london’s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way british airways has by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced ryanair which is a no-frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something i will never be flying ba again and plan on converting my company away from ba flights as well be warned stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise, gatwick to alicante on my outbound flight (23 sept) i gave ba almost 10 out of 10 across the board in a review they invited me to complete on my return flight (26 sept) it was a different matter from entering alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard (except the vip lounge which was good) travelling club europe had no advantages only one check in open for all passengers no bag drop facilities no facility to print boarding passes when invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane the iberia factor honestly you wouldn't have thought it was the same company once on the plane everything went like clockwork, vancouver to london great flight on the superb a380; in my opinion the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment outstanding in flight service from the crew attentive polite and professional; the very best of british airways service food well above average for this cabin - though breakfast could have been better ife excellent the seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket very enjoyable flight highly recommended, gatwick to alicante 35 hours (1 hour sitting on tarmac) with my knees rammed against seat in front no room to move i have travelled on several airlines on this route in last 12 months - vueling airlines has best seats stay away from the rest unless you are under 5ft tall, we have had some torrid experiences with ba - which we have not been shy to report so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way it felt right to feedback on that the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were frankly wonderful cheerful efficient and calm what more could you ask the food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely the beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy i literally cannot think of any real negatives the luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’ sadly the current ceo doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time as we entered the (literally empty) immigration area we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars surreal as anyone who regularly travels to the states will testify it felt as if we were living in the truman show at one point but in the nicest possible way get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct fantastic, london heathrow to austin with british airways it was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to austin but it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for a long time it was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldn’t do enough for you and always with a smile we arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air on time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience the only slight issue was the very ife systems and small overhead lockers but plenty of spare lockers and our ipads took are of that, the start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge awaiting flights on airlines other than ba as it was weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes once airborne in a refitted a320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell) cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable it was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear a big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was wifi which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £499 for an hour's use i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers but evidently not landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights however ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later so not too bad all in all, glasgow to london smooth flight departure/arrival on time boarding was quick the seat was ok although i had pre-ordered a vegetarian option the caterer hadn't provided any (so they said) - but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue the food was good and the wine (french bourgogne) also surprisingly good flight attendant was professional polite and attentive to detail all in all a great flight, having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before i was apprehensive as to how it would operate the check-in and security clearance at t5 took only 15 minutes personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not 100% confident that i did everything correctly boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket again i'm not a fan of this possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights the aircraft was a large a321 boarding was however smooth on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (i'm 1m79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front) the departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time in flight there were 3 cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin (believe 2 in club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline the landing at tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not ba's fault, london to kefalonia  the t5 galleries lounge is showing its age and was packed at 9:30 on a saturday boarding was by the now standard groups which meant waiting 15 minutes in a queue and then 10 minutes on the bridge the flight deck then informed us that we’d be waiting on a stand for 1 hr 20 minutes before our departure slot once in the air cabin crew delivered the usual club europe experience which was mediocre at best fortunately arrival was only 45 minutes late and we were out of kefalonia airport 30 minutes later overall a typical ba experience that’s lacklustre at best, gatwick to seville when my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay 50gbp because one of the suitcases was 4cm oversize and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage staff said that if he did not pay he would lose the flight, belfast to san francisco via london check-in at belfast city was fast and trouble free and security was completed with-in just a few minutes with no queues to mention boarding was direct from the business lounge and on time as was departure a full breakfast service was carried out including hot towels hot breakfast tea and coffee along with drinks from the bar on request the galleries lounge in terminal 5 at heathrow was very busy with limited seats available boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift the inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner food was plentiful and tasty entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine no complaints at all about the flight and would recommend british airways, london to gothenburg ba are getting a lot of bad press - deservedly so at present with strikes it glitches baggage problems however extreme cases will always be highlighted two recent flights on ba and very happy with them flight to gothenburg on a319-100 pushed back 25m late due to a potential technical issue soon resolved and arrived at got only 15m behind schedule good crew and the safety announcement video was a hoot return to lhr on a320-232 on time departure and early arrival at t5 again good crew will be flying with ba again in december (strikes permitting) still recommended by me as the national carrier, mahe to stockholm via london checked in online before the flight but had to do the bag drop was met by a rude lady at first class check in and the process took about 20 minutes don’t know why no apology the boarding was in time the welcome wasn’t especially friendly just pointing the direction where to go the club europe cabin felt claustrophobic i had a window seat the csm never came to say hello the service was pretty basic ok during the meals but self service between no drink service if you didn’t ask on the flight to stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members the service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly the seating was terrible on this a320 so tight, glasgow to tampa via gatwick early morning flight glasgow to gatwick flight dud take off at 645 boarded with doors closed by 630 bug did not depart till 710 due to gatwick being busy smooth flight down gatwick to tampa according to manage my booking aircraft changed 2 days prior to departure at boarding was told our world traveller plus seats had been upgraded to club world a very pleasant surprise if was on 777 which had not been refurbished extra space was very good staff were very efficient and pleasant only downside was the main meal which i would have had in original seats but main courses were not to my liking but afternoon tea was very good so thank you ba for the experience, london to abu dhabi this is the daytime flight from london a very good flight the food was excellent for economy (particularly in view of etihad‘s disastrous changes in food service) the children’s meals were excellent the entertainment system was great with a good selection it makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate especially when flying with children (etihad why don’t you do this) the cabin crew were good economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than many good value flight especially as the only other carrier to abu dhabi is etihad, sydney to london via singapore with british airways i made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous i was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables i am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up the latter i took one bite and couldn't continue i have had better meals in economy class in other airlines the seat was nothing to write home about but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course) the service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available on the plus side i am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights paid for in-flight wifi for an a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use reasonable price and speed, london to johannesburg british airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel but in addition if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments with that said in 2018 my wife and i made reservations on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october specifically 10/31 yes that's the day called for brexit only we made our reservations before those dates were set considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september 2019 coupled with brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection the good news is close to $800 in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage the bad news is the $22000 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses i was just not feeling the love here so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airways all of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance instead of ba we changed our booking to 10/30 on etihad airways through abu dhabi their customer service was outstanding the fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other i am entering travel in september 2019 because there was no other option for future travel this request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight this is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware, i had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from chennai to london by british airways the chennai ground service manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley screening the luggage checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person i am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth thank you so much inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if i need any help and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard i did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at heathrow airport over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with ba and heathrow airport #happyautism# thank you, edinburgh to kuala lumpur via london i have just returned to kl from an extended visit in uk seeing family and friends my return flight was ba033 from heathrow to kuala lumpur on monday 26th august 2019 at 2110 i was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name i didn't quite catch the point i wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight she was exceptional it really made the journey one of the best on board experiences i have had, london to shanghai the concorde room in heathrow terminal 5 was amazing the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious however the first galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad on the plane the crew was very friendly and nice dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off the food was okay bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable perhaps the best i have had the entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like qatar airlines and emirates overall the journey was great, i have often flown british airways and have considered them a good airline however their customer service has fallen to such a level that i must say it is terrible if you have no problems this is a good airline if you have any problems you will not be able to get any help i recently flew to london from chicago they erroneously cancelled my seats although i had checked in over 5 hours before he flight they then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane they then lost my luggage for 15 days these things happen but customer service was impossible to use when you call you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up if you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you they do not you can't find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you, good morning i would like to write a review for british airways it took me a while to write this review as i it took me a while to get over what happened to me but i feel that the way british airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts last year i went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to new orleans from london on the holiday of a life time i was pregnant at the time the baby died while i was on holiday there and i was in a turmoil of emotions regardless i tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in england somehow i missed the flight back i have no excuse for this when i realised i was in a complete state i had a break down i rang ba and sobbed down the phone they were beyond amazing they arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost we all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and i was in hospital the day afterwards customer service was outstanding so compassionate and helpful and again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights i am beyond grateful for their help i will only ever fly ba on long haul if possible, london gatwick to san jose costa rica this was a very similar experience outbound and inbound i am sure the plane was the same i am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen ba i am seriously considering not doing this again the 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old i flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated the screens were from the ark crew as always excellent but ba should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience i was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue i have heard to date zip at least it was better than last year flying into dc from london when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster that time at least we received avios the customer service is increasingly low cost in feel, from toronto to pisa british airways used a wet leased air belgium plane crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily food was excellent business class cabin comfortable weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at lhr to our great surprise british airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family (7 people ranging from 3 to 62 years) from terminal 5 to terminal 3 escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to pisa without this transfer help we would have missed our connection flight to pisa on time good crew good on board catering arrived 15 minutes before the time, a very good service on board this flight with british airways from lhr to vce although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an airbus a319 to and airbus a320 we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time the crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new) the seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room one small issue that i could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board you had to pay or use avios (it isn't that bad as it was only to europe) an overall very good experience on board this flight, london to larnaca new a321neo 45 hour flight the aircraft was narrow the food simple nothing worth spending my money the staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn't worth it no entertainment onboard it is a small plane for this duration, gatwick to orlando excellent customer service on arriving at gatwick airport and checking in i learn that my interpretation of the usa esta rules was wrong and that i would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip this took longer than it should have and ba kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft the aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time during the flight drinks were served and two food services towards the end of the flight i developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring so despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger ba really came through for me the return journey went without a hitch and ba's check in at orlando was quick and easy, london to munich the plane is a320 the seat is more comfortable than other airlines a320 it has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather there is enough legroom however there is no free food and drinks provided, no problems at the airport in vienna it was easy to find the british airways check in desk the flight was on time the cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant i also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was very delicious the only problem was at heathrow because the gate bridge had a malfunction so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft but it is not an airliner mistake after all i enjoyed the flight with british airways, london to nice i agree totally with the comments made in michael croft's review today my flight to nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable it system that ba have while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs the handling of the situation at heathrow was despicable and you would think that with all the failures that ba encounter these days they would have got this part of their act together they make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue when clearly they have not been investing where they should instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses not just the ceo should go but some others at the top, london heathrow to sofia we checked in online so we went straight to baggage drop it was quick and worked well our bag was 25 kg maximum is 23 kg so we had to take 2 kg out after that we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags show our passport and then go through to security my daughter was beeped but it wasn't a big deal it was fast and our flight was departing in 1h 30m we got some drinks and then we noticed our gate was announced early we headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later boarding was fast and we were sitting in seats 33 def the seats were comfortable leather and had headrests a321 so there was no ife we had a 1 hour delay from the bad airspace but eventually took off our route was a little different instead of going over france switzerland etc we went over germany hungary etc the food was good and wasn't too expensive we didn't buy anything really just food while coming into bulgaria the views were nice the landing was pretty good despite the bump eventually we got off 1 hour late and we went home the verdict is that british airways are pretty good despite the delay, buenos aires to london heathrow my wife and i flew back from argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess (amelia) who gave great service to everyone with her friendly professional manner on finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card the trip itself left on time and arrived in london early the aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable the entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen , i was flying ba to delhi in economy because my original flight with swissair was cancelled the 777 aircraft is looking old the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens (films are ok the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone) and the food is just ok the flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time (allowing for the rerouting around pakistani airspace), seattle to durban via london on 24th of july i arrived late just before departure time 1330hrs the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel the british airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart i rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents when i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in durban as i sat down in the plane another british airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in durban on my arrival in durban i got all my bags including my back pack i would like to say thank you to the british airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in its a pity i didn't get their names i was panicky thank you so much, johannesburg to cape town return this flight was operated by comair and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business johannesburg airport and cape town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites they even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6 as there is actually tons of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking these seats were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a 2x3 configuration i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737 it works and makes sense i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways and they were the same price as the competition south african airways i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa's busiest air route for the price paid i'd be happy to fly them again, grenada to gatwick having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin the cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant the entertainment system was hugely improved with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated but the family really found them entertaining for me the real issue was the tight leg room - i am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal it was for me very tight previously the seat format was 3-3-3 it is now 3-4-3 we were sat in the 4 outbound although on return we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2 we sat in a 2 which was more bearable i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit despite best efforts to sleep i failed i remember the old seats being more comfortable especially for long haul service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible in summary it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience but seat comfort has been sacrificed which is a great pity, london to dubai lately i am frequently flying premium economy with british airways the extra comfort compared to economy class is unparalleled the seat is way more comfortable attendants are really professional and very friendly if just could add the leg rest into all the other seats and not just the first row (as it used to be in the old ba premium economy seats) then it would be perfect that's my only note, tel aviv to toronto via london the plane from london to toronto was run by air belgium the service from checkin until we received our cases here in israel was excellent the cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly the food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight the planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights i haven't travelled british airways for years but i will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights, the first part from brussels to london heathrow was a fast flight however on the ground in london the problems started the gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes the captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous continental breakfast in business was ok for this short flight flight to larnaca was full embarkation was prompt for business pax the team was very friendly the service started with a drink and some cookies  the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser it must be said the meal was an improvement since last year decent drinks and a good champagne were available followed by coffee or tea it is a longer flight - a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks, premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace the food (i use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it the veg tasted burnt bread roll was ok (not really a saving grace) one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table i didn’t bother trying it the look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother which in comparison to the outbound flight (london to orlando) was worlds apart greeted with a drink which was the first of many dinner was nice the steak edible veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane but that really shouldn’t happen what is not told when booking homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you don’t have to join the massive queue look for pre entered tsa line that’s the one that’s empty cause they tell no one about it, frankfurt to london ba staff watched while security went through partner's bag for around 30 mins it required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while - actually just clothes when they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight only 1-2 minutes required much longer spent unloading my luggage we had checked this bag in almost 2 hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time, return flight to dublin outbound galleries north fine and good breakfast flight was fine return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed lounge at dublin was generic lounge but was ok staff on both flights fine return aircraft quite new and well presented, barbados to gatwick we boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick i had a beer and my partner a soft drink i was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us i enquired what the meal was and we were both told pasta it’s all we have left everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta my partner refused her pasta and i proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy i said only one was required as i would eat the pasta glad i did i think chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt during this service no further drinks were offered except for water trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours they reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake i politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread tea and coffee was served  our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite pleasant staff food standard but acceptable the only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers the crew turned a blind eye the positives the ife has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights i have ever been on, i would like to praise the outstanding courtesy and service i received from the ba cabin crew members during my flight ba0011 from london heathrow to singapore on 25 june the cabin crew were both friendly and attentive to their passengers needs enabling them to relax & enjoy their flight i feel very proud that british airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard it really is a privilege to fly british airways, ba762 heathrow to oslo i have flown with ba a few times in the last few months i have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes i had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above and beyond for me they had gave me a free bottle of water kept asking if i was okay put their arm around me made me feel so much better the flight was super smooth and overall an amazing service thanks again ba and i will be flying again with you soon, new york to glasgow via london a routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7) i had an electronic boarding pass on the ba app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions there was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task the pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate i would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them i had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout the middle seat was unoccupied enough leg space and storage space overhead a good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided the ife system was easy to use a drink service preceded the meal service i asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed ipa brewdog speedbird 100 sensing that i might not enjoy it the attendant also gave me a heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter the entree choices were chicken and pasta i chose the later very basic food tea and coffee followed before landing a sandwich and a drink was served i could not figure out what was in the sandwich the bathroom was clean blankets and pillows were on every seat alighting was quick landing cards have been done away with for the fare i paid i was satisfied - no complaints i connected to a domestic flight to glasgow the announcement of the gate was made quite late newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity it was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating i was in an aisle seat the next to me was empty no complimentary food or drink on this segment the two flight attendants once the plane reached cruising altitude put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs the pilot introduced them as gorgeous both on this and the earlier flight a video presentation showed off the safety instructions it was supposed to be funny and engaging i felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand the flight landed on time overall a positive experience but next time i will look into a non-stop flight to glasgow from new york the transfer at heathrow is anxiety-inducing, london heathrow to new york the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience refreshing to see these days the quality of food and drinks was wonderful there was plenty of leg room as well we would definitely fly again with ba and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations on departure my tv did not work they tried twice to reset it for me however this did not work that was fine i resolved to reading my book just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us asked if it had been rectified i replied no but it was ok she came back with a bottle of champagne a pair of pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies not just for me but for my sister as well to say i was overwhelmed was an understatement all i can say is thank you british airways from the bottom of my heart the trip was for my birthday and you certainly made it something special, gatwick to bermuda boarded very quickly and on time seating area smart appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up service very good food was the best i have had from ba new crockery added to the good feel and appearance long overdue duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high-cost route the pillow is fabulous gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use 10/10 for this flight and the crew even though it was full up front i hope this is a turning point for british airways thank you i am looking forward to my seychelles flight in october and my rio flight in december keep it coming, london heathrow to larnaca perfect the early morning departure meant that terminal 5 was unusually quiet the galleries lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment the flight took off and landed on time the cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience arrival procedures at larnaca were incredibly efficient we completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate all in all a very enjoyable trip, ba 2616 and 2617 return trip from gatwick to cagliari both flights on a saturday and were full aircraft was an a320-200 on both legs sat in row 7 outbound 2 rows behind club europe sat in row 25 on the return leg room seemed tighter than row 7 the brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the bmi fleet didn’t bother with the new m&s on board service outward but did on the return the m&s sandwich was everything you would expect from an m&s sandwich (apart from the cost) but the coffee i had and the tea my wife had were below standard it also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25 the other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in club europe attending to just 10 passengers despite quite a lot of turbulence and the seat belt sign on for about 30 minutes they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful you are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley and they would not return to their seats the rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land outbound flight was fine inbound flight was not a great advertisement for ba perhaps standards at lgw are not as good as at lhr, heathrow to kalamata heathrow t5 to kalamata greece 8th june and return 1 week later used avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out also left kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time seats much more comfortable with more padding than for example ryanair or jet2com so with the extra legroom the flights were pretty comfortable expensive (or course) m&s offerings for food but tasty enough pleasant fa's so all in all decent flights haven't used ba for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right, amsterdam to london on 15th april i arrived 3 hours before flight where i waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency after that rather lengthy delaywhen i got to the gate on time i was told the gate was shut thinking it must have been some kind of joke i noted with the british airways representatives saying that i was on time she replied yes but you were the last person everyone had made it before me my bags were already offloaded she continued to say  after asking what do i do now not having the ability to ring abroad i asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no qantas office in amsterdam and they cannot help me, istanbul to london my first flight in economy is the new a321 neo the aircraft is set up with the first 15 rows of regular seats and the remaining 17 rows of the new extra slim economy seats the seat does not recline is very thin and ok for an hour flight however 3 hours 45 minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after 2 hours the 5 members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual ms for sale products, i had some difficulty from the start after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in even though i was already logged in i wanted to reserve seats and request special meals it took me 2 days to achive this i was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats no extra legroom this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the lhr-kul and return kul-lhr legs i had difficulty checking in using the ba app and eventually did it using malaysia airlines app checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference i was looking forward to flying on the boeing 787 but it really is just a dream food choices we were told ran out at breakfast the choice was full english or just an omelette but the full english ran out or so we were told but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full english on it earlier meals were ok with beer wine and other drinks available there was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water for an over 12h flight i think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy the ife selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music our return flight from kl to london was very cold the boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat, london to dusseldorf no free drinks or food which is pretty normal for short haul flights crew was pretty average seat was average ground crew was pretty nice no inflight entertainment, london to vancouver economy was a lot more cramped than i expected ba had crammed seats in crew were okay food reasonable really although i had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame flew back premium class more room i probably won’t use them in november when i go back timing was good and air quality felt ok as i didn’t get a headache, standard run of the mill airline for today's economy flew tel aviv to new york with a two hour layover in london heathrow crew was fine entertainment system on the london to new york leg was very nice the special meal i ordered was not on either of the two flights i  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system and was assured they were i submitted a complaint to bacom and the responses i received were lame and unacceptable not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from british airways as i suggested topping off my avios balance to a mere 5000 points (my balance is around 3500), belfast city to atlanta via london heathrow t5 check-in was fairly smooth at belfast as it was early in the morning however when the agent called me over the check me in he was all flustered that i wasn't an elite executive club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty i knew he was working the premium line but nobody was standing in it and i was standing in the regular line when he called me after about 20 minutes i finally got a boarding pass to go through security the flight from bhd to lhr was uneventful and bare-bones as nothing was served for free on the flight my boyfriend therefore hated it as we're used to getting better service on american in the us but i was fully aware that ba had turned itself into a glorified easyjet once we arrived to lhr i continued by myself to atlanta on ba and was shocked at the crowded user-unfriendly t5 although i suppose it was pretty in some ways i had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called so it felt very crowded and hot after my flight was called i found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people boarding was straightforward however and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers even in economy the flight product was just ok in my view i had an exit row aisle seat and while i had extra room and a nice headrest the seat was right by the lav so it stank ife was fine with a decent selection but it was not as complete as delta's the food was the bland equivalent of what delta serves so no brownie points there and the \"tea\" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages i remember years ago when ba was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile those smiles have disappeared for the most part and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there however i arrived on time and promptly got my bag the 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite so i might fly them again though i would not recommend ba due to the crowds and discomfort i experienced at t5, buenos aires to london i wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while i was terribly sick wish i knew their names they gave me medicine a blanket and caressed my back while i was crying from the stomach ache forever grateful, flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only boeing 747-400 that was in old boac retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the ife was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness, i had kept my laptop bag in the overhead cabin somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldn't fit the bag in the space remaining so they kept the bag on my laptop bag when i asked the flight attendant to help me with this he asked me to keep my luggage down  i was travelling with only one laptop bag placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out how fair is this, london to delhi a truly first class experience from check in to landing i am a frequent flyer with ba and have not always had an amazing experience this one was check in was easy and swift and the concorde room was excellent the flight itself was wonderful while i accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none the cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing new soft product is very good and food definitely much improved, london to seattle my husband and i have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in america we have always been very satisfied with the service unfortunately i was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb i’d like to thank the cabin crew and captain for the care i received during the last two hours of the flight advice was sought via radio i was made comfortable in the galley at least one crew member with me at all times given oxygen etc paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when i was then given a thorough medical check a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as i was not well enough to walk to the car park we met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how i was many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that i must have disturbed, london to milan evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty boarding by group number worked effectively and i was able to store my laptop in the overhead free newspapers were available in the jet way passengers were warmly greeted i was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently usual on board trolley service which i didn't use flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in linate 20 minutes late return flight could have been a challenge due to italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early the cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding we were taken off the aircraft and bussed into t5 which i think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control all in all a couple of very good flights, the connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight everything went smoothly and service was good boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin much has been said about the ba ying-yang seat configuration the seats are narrow and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat however the seat is very comfortable in any position and the white company bedding is excellent we had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger the service on this flight was superb from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient quick to respond and super friendly preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off there was a choice of 4 starters 3 mains and 3 sweets or cheeseboard with a decent choice of wines breakfast offered a good choice although we were happy with just the fruit yoghurt and bread there could be no complaints in respect of catering the a380 is a super aircraft and very quiet but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew our connecting flight to leeds was good but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat it is a short flight but there was still a full meal service the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds the airport seems quite run-down escalator not working and few staff to be seen there was only one other arrival but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through, london heathrow to los angeles very nice experience i read other reviews slamming ba but that was not the experience we had from the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive food was good not great but very good seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review) again the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run in flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with i like over the monitors aa does a very good job on this one world route as well but i would take ba over aa if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls, cpt is definitely getting its act together: ba's galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once the upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in club world that's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious the dinner service was according to the new cw 'soft' design which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually on the whole i think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it rather than served with the dessert breakfast has been streamlined too and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff apart from some inevitable turbulence the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule a good flight overall but an old style business class experience, i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating so my initial impression was disappointed for business class however into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available and i needed to ask for a pillow the menu guide was on cheap paper and with no convenient place to store it for reference later was very ordinary the evening meal was acceptable (soup steak/veg fruits ) was ok served with freezing cold cutlery bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles asthma puffer or water bottle the breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf 11 from singapore to brisbane insisting i needed to collect my luggage leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight i am 73 with some mobility problems requiring assistance so this was a worry for me when i arrived in singapore the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight, flight was ok minor delay didn't both me what was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at lyon airport they were training new ground staff at the same time they continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight, gatwick to barbados return i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful however the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us with the result that we got through arrivals quickly the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years once again when you travel west to east the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less) no bread was served with dinner despite there being butter on the plate so i presume it was missed my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else which was fine however as the crew were serving the remaining meals there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys when they reached our row they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made my wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner once again we landed on time which was a good thing overall the return flight was extremely poor, the cabin crew on flight ba035 london to chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients i did tell them i would write a review and here it is keep up the good service and thanks, gatwick to malaga check in was fairly quick the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets if you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit the food and drink offering was very good tasty and varied on board i was lucky to be able to book the exit row which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me the food offering is fairly poor really a couple of sandwiches or snacks drinks selection is better what was very nice was near the end of the flight i was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member i wouldn’t expect this and i’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers still no wifi or wifi based in flight entertainment offered priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant my bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags overall a decent flight and very good value as i paid using avios being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus, boston to london heathrow was excited to experience a380 for the first time paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the window seat itself was the standard one comfortable the boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft there was never a massive crowd in front of the gate the inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal the food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it there was serious bumps along the way midflight the a380 being so massive easily absorbed it return was on a b777 - flight was not full but almost full the inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey the baggage drop area however was a disaster none of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers the boarding was again very orderly both outbound and inbound ife was good but not as good as some long haul carriers if both legs had similar cabin crew and food i would have scored them higher, london to cape town in first and our first taste of the new 'soft' product still unfortunately a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age a wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in first and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service the young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food for once nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent bedding is also improved with a good quality duvet and large pillow the ife remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film the goodies bag is much better and worth taking home overall a pretty good flight but it remains to be seen what ba will do with its long-in-the-tooth first class when their new club suites are launched, this review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on ba 174 from jfk new york to heathrow on tue 14th may i was travelling back from new york following a few days break with 11 girlfriends check in and boarding was all on schedulehowever it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving ny despite this annoying delay the cabin crew more than made up for this they were friendly polite and couldn't do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable they were all exceptional even those that were not serving in the section i was in i do hope that this information is passed on, london to aberdeen before boarding the flight i was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and i was boarding in group 5 i was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the boarding gate i saw people boarding with tax free bags on top of the other bags being almost the last on the plane there was free spaces to accommodate bags i was not happy because i had the permitted allowance, gatwick to dubrovnik overcrowded lounges business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty lgw lounge opens one hr before some eu flights in morning only and met by a large queue and now frequent flyers don’t get free baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets, vancouver to london an excellent flight on ba i travel this route several times a year and generally ba are much better than ac especially on this flight ba were way ahead of the competition seats comfortable food pretty good for economy decent wine and the in flight crew simply outstanding professional smiling friendly they embodied ba at their very best, washington to london having travelled out to washington from heathrow on 23/04/19 first class i wasn't overly impressed although the concorde room was relaxing and comfortable the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive the cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach my return journey couldn't have been more different the ba lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew nothing short of amazing i was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach a fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist having had mixed levels of service with ba and always flying virgin i think ba need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training, rome fiumicino to london city a ba cityflyer service no wait to check in aircraft was not full we pushed back early and arrived early this route still has complimentary refreshments in economy including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise cabin service was pleasant and professional a really excellent flight, london city to zurich i fly this route a lot around 8 times per year the flight was delayed initially by an hour i was kept up to date via the app so i was not disappointed around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a happy birthday followed by a bottle of champagne brandy etc this was totally unexpected it made my day thanks to the crew, london to calgary thank you to james a club world flight attendant on ba 0103 april 15 2019 his service was impeccable attentive and delightful i thoroughly enjoyed the flight, vancouver to london we were upgraded to business class at the airport the staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip really they could not have been more helpful and i would recommend them, miami to london heathrow with british airways top deck of 747 with one experienced and one new crew members perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected on-time arrival and aa arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers, london heathrow to bengaluru i found the crew very friendly and even humorous whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (i was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs  one air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter, dublin to london heathrow british airways offered a very good overall service on this flight i booked online and found that process very easy the caveat was not being able to select the seat i wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee the check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself the flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements within the previous two weeks i had flown with ba twice within europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff the flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort one curiosity was the staff handing out uk landing cards the flight was punctual and reliable, london to seattle my seat was on the upper deck a nice perk for seattle flights to europe (ba is the only one flying 747s to europe from seattle) overall the product is outdated service was not at the level it used to be staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum  upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum  no additional service no top ups not offering water during the flight of course if you ask for something you do get it there was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck  i hope ba will improve their act i certainly won’t use their services in foreseeable future, london to gibraltar check in at t3 was fine lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine skilled landing in gibraltar- a good flight, london to doha similar to our outbound flight the seats are comfortable but behind the competition very small storage area  if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough the food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet though the taste was ok the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage, london heathrow to houston despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional they really seemed to be enjoying their work lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight commendably even in these days of austerity my pre lunch gin was served with fever tree tonic well done ba frequent drinks runs were made despite its age the jumbo was well turned out internally the only downside was because of air traffic issues at heathrow the flight arrived late this meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight this was mainly down to tardy immigration procedures the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight all very stressful, larnaca to london this a320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight if the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare the seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous  you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing, the booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book the cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well my gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty  some of the to buy m&s food items were not available and the lavatory i used was dirty the staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy hardworking crew, london to tokyo narita had a fantastic flight in the new ba first cabin on the boeing 787 on both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service the food was of high end restaurant standard the seat comfortable, bridgetown to london gatwick paid for a business class flight the onboard service was abysmal no refreshments offered on boarding dinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight) my husband had to go to the galley twice for his dinner requests he’d been forgotten i requested ‘express’ service which didn’t happen website advertises ‘premium levels of service’ and ‘every journey unique and unforgettable’ the service was dreadful but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons don’t waste your money with this airline you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points and telling you that you don’t pay for the service that the extra costs are for taxes the lounge and extra loyalty points all ba could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points really, st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article 73 of ec 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights he then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed rightly or wrongly was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem what further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions never telling the passenger to raise their seat ba’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of ba but for me their service is going backwards the music that accompanies the advert is called ‘salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it article 10 of ec regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you, chicago to london cancelled flights just a few hours before i left home then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight was finally put on a different flight on the way home because my first flight was through american airlines and the second through british airways (all in the same booking) i was only able to check in and get a seat on the american airlines flight as i was redirected every time to their website couldn’t check in for the british airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable i always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat but ba wouldn’t allow me to do this, london to seville following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with ba despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor i quickly called up ba to resolve the issue they understood the problem and gave me a full refund the agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem i don’t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning however it’s great to see ba treat their customers with care, doha to paris via london this is the first time using ba since october 2002 nothing has changed  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with ba and left them behind with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice it cannot compare with other business leaders like cathay and qatar airways but on this route ba charges the same price as qatar airways but delivers a much poorer product though the service was ok not as personal but alright where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous i will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class, madrid to london ba0457 on the 18/03 couldn't have been a better service long time since i flew club europe but it was an amazing experience the welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food stephen one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience i have had in a long time well done to the crew on that flight, on the flight to tokyo i was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon thanks the return felt like a 12 hour easyjet flight one meal and one half meal limited drinks very small seats i’m 5 foot 9 and my knees touched the seat in front very very mediocre, london to vancouver check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options very smooth process the disappointment was the receptionist at the galleries lounge at t3 who was rude and unhelpful all was redeemed once on board the crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best british airways tradition - friendly helpful and attentive food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines wines better than many airlines the aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older 747-400 ife selection good, leeds bradford to las vegas via heathrow customer services handling of my question never answered it three times i asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over £100 on the outbound flight this was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short lba lhr fare i asked why the fare was so much when i could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50 the response was we are doing what everyone else is doing they never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when i indicated one checked bag i asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to book lhr las at that time and one bag included customer service apparently did not understand what i was asking because the answer provided was non-responsive, tenerife to heathrow effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service seats are rigid and i felt as if i was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight when i tried to put my seat back to recline i estimate it moved around 5 degrees leg room is also non existent m&s food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons furthermore several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers ba again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the ba brand they are professional friendly and courteous it's clear that british airways are not the airline they once were and i hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory, los angeles to london a very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787 ba have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight  if you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the \"turn right\" section in business class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally() by economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding food and drinks were excellent with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived well done ba for providing such a good product and service, rome to london one of the best european airlines to travel with for short haul flights the online website is very clear and easy to use check-in procedure was smooth the gate was very close to the shopping area boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge the only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink as they don’t serve anything free on all european routes, tampa to gatwick i paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when i got to the airport they wouldn't let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they can't do anything and i can't get on the plane they waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and won't reimburse me for the seats that i paid for but never received, london heathrow to madrid i travel from lhr regularly british airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality as a frequent traveler i've been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats this airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members the lounge at heathrow terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments the bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available i'm very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend british airways keep it up guys, it's been many years since i flew long haul british airways and i was pleasantly surprised by recent flights ba staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed from the time of arriving at london heathrow t5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful similarly on the flight the attendants couldn't do enough for me when i requested tomato juice with worcester sauce the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it on the way back i asked for a tonic water and again they offered to go and get it the seating of these newer planes allows me knee room even though i'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too the entertainment system though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of cathay pacific nevertheless had a good range of movies and tv to watch both flights ended up arriving on time despite delays at heathrow both ways and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on food quality was reasonable again not up to the standard of cathay pacific rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which i thought was a bit mean overall a very pleasant flight thanks ba is this because competition is hotting up and ba now have to try harder, london heathrow / pisa return my wife and i fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in tuscany sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price or we pay using avios this return trip was the latter it is what it is the most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world i have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return ba should be ashamed of themselves the only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions the seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit the new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free) booze the seats are the biggest con three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster on the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine on the way back - a ploughman's lunch it was okay-ish as a 60 year old businessman one who has worked globally in my career in the us japan and the middle east - and having sold my business a few years ago to one of the largest plcs in the country - i think i know a bit about running companies i know i could do a lot better than the current board at ba last week when i was away i read that ba have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year oh what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors so what would i do with club europe i'd make it the best in europe the seat would be larger like an arm chair a 2+2 configuration there would be a nice centre table charge ports for phones/laptops headsets tv screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours extra 6\" of leg room behind row \"1\" nice cutlery and glass/china ware hot meals and i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more \"build value guys\" and the profits will follow its the oldest dictum in the book i will give credit where credit is due on the way back on the ground the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk the length of plane asking if anyone had concerns or questions one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure very nice chap we took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine fas in both directions were very good, flew out of heathrow on 22nd feb to new york 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our tv's weren't working (4 travellers) but i have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour the reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were the crew on this flight were amazing nothing was too much trouble thank you to all involved on that flight, london city to florence my flight was at around 7am in the morning not only it got canceled 3 hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking on their site i had the option to reschedule my flight but i couldn’t select any flights on the same day interestingly i was able to find & book another one through skyscanner again with ba at the day of my initial flight with £100 more of course why couldn’t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page, london to johannesburg since the aircraft was half full i was looking for a great flight we left on time and that was the only positive point i started watching a movie and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice i told her that i would love a g&t to start with and then i will read the menu she told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served i insisted (this is business class after all half full flight) 30 minutes later she brought a tray with everything on it (g&t first dish main dish and dessert)  never was i offered wine or coffee the lights were turned off and i did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing  other passengers in business where treated the same and complained, miami to tel aviv via london at miami airport on october 2018 what a pleasure was dealing with the agent so professional nice and helpful to the every last detail now on february 2019 calling british airways to redeem my avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient knowledgeable and nice agent she explained everything in such detail you are doing great with such fantastic employees, london to seoul i normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of club was prohibitive and so i thought i would give world traveller plus a go the cabin is stylish and intimate and i was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were the entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying) i was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming my only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available a similar thing happened with breakfast three options the third being the most appetizing and no it hadn't been loaded so this is an area ba might want to look into all in all the service was good and worth the price for ground service ba please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work, london heathrow to new york jfk bag drop did not go well lounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowded boarding was fine small delay well organised pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous main meal good pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it on time arrival a good flight cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile i thought this was a good flight, gatwick to st lucia flew ba new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up well lit cabin improved seating comfort better and operational entertainment system (always hit or miss before) and decent food cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant i have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at ba and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of today’s experience i will consider them in the future much improved well done, london to chennai it was amazing the crew were very friendly the food was amazing and the seats were comfortable t was overall an amazing flight and i enjoyed it thoroughly, flying premium economy on british airways from new orleans to london was an absolute pleasure the nine hour flight was an amazing experience with great legroom reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again, tokyo to london i was looking forward to this flight because of the club world ticket and because it was my first time flying on a boeing 787 we had a good check-in experience breezed through the airport and enjoyed the jal lounge at narita we boarded on time and first impressions of the boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded the food and wines were really good i had a beautifully-presented japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options there was plenty of choice on the ife and there was a big screen on the downside the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight this was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too the seat was comfortable and reclined fully but i find the layout of ba club world a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle the cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming the context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to tokyo we had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew we both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight, london to tokyo haneda my wife and i treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to japan with the help of my avios and a ba amex companion voucher we were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at heathrow was great we boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint we had very grand seats with lovely surroundings the cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted the food and alcoholic drinks were great i went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding i was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the ife my wife and i both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably my only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep, i was flying london to billund today via british airways and i was a bit hesitant as i’ve never flown with this airline due to early morning traffic i was running a little behind schedule and i had a 23kg bag to also check in and check in closed 45 mins before my flight departs upon arrival i was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful he calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay as i was very very stressed thinking i was going to miss my flight he then offered to give me fast track through security so i could get to my gate quicker i just want to thank him again as he made my experience with british airways like no other and i’m very grateful, san diego to frankfurt via london it all started when trying to check in online 24h before departure from san diego to heathrow on long flights like this i always reserve an aisle seat online check-in did not work no reason was given ok let’s call us hotline i tried at least 40 times answers were either that call could not be completed check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now i did not make it through as an act of desperation i today called a british number the lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats available some other numbers i tried were available on weekdays only good to know if you need help on a sunday so i‘ve got the strong feeling that they do not even care about there customers b on my flight to san diego 5 days ago my tv screen was gone and there was no way to change seats great overall experience, london heathrow to paris cdg quick and easy flight to paris took just 40 minutes to reach cdg everything went well and the cabin was very clean the only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized, johannesburg to london at johannesburg used ba galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy plane boarded on time very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit given aircraft at jnb all day perhaps this could have been addressed after take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal portions of starter very small i was given someone else’s by mistake which was then taken away and given to him i thought that originally the idea of the new club world meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that main was good (beef) dessert was cheese very small basic selection then bed gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable breakfast was ok delay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue (there seemed to be a few of these) arrivals lounge was good overall an average experience, edinburgh to bangalore via heathrow rude staff poor service missing baggage poor entertainment system i spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal i apologised for my clumsiness but i was made to feel like i had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me i asked for tissues and the answer was get it from the toilet the staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if i needed another drink once i cleaned myself up the crew were also extremely noisy chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration and then - while boarding at edinburgh they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full the staff wrote bangalore via heathrow but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight 4 hours gap mind you, new york jfk to london heathrow with british airways an extremely average flight nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as bad the flight was smooth and felt quite short the cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable the inflight entertainment needed some work, i've always favoured british airways and will always try and choose to fly with them which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel i have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering for economy however ba have stripped both the above perks i now struggle to see the value and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of easyjet yet you pay almost double then today i flew back from denmark with sas and it was amazing and made ba look cheap not only do you get a good meal on board you get free drink can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 29 euros) outstanding, a380 boarding is always a nightmare but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots fortunately we still managed to take off more or less on time the cabin crew responsible for our side of the first cabin was personable but lacked experience the food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience the seats in first are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin the duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin one of the first toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the club world loos upstairs it would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience but no comment was made the ife was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used wifi was available but i didn't make use of it breakfast was unremarkable and i wish bread rather than pastries was offered deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at t5 and the lack of a stand overall a reasonable flight but not first class, the 2-3-2 seating in the front section of club world on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2 but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers a full cabin also means queues for the two loos although they're a lot more spacious than in first the drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours but the revamped club world food is definitely an improvement the fish option for the main course was some of the best food i've had in the air the white company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats cabin crew were generally good and the csm was particularly visible during the flight breakfast was improved with the option to pre-select items arrival was ahead of schedule, london to johannesburg smooth check in via club world desks fast track security was fast and got to lounge quickly lounge was ok food a little better and staff seemed more attentive we were able to use the spa which was nice showers were fine with no queues flight left on time my first experience of the new club world catering which seemed to go well slept for 5 hours lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older 777’s which (as my son says) have a gap between stool and seat sometimes crew on this sector were good and the fa serving our area was experienced and it showed the csd seemed to go through the motions only arrival fine and baggage was first on belt a good flight, ba836 on 19 jan excellent short flight from heathrow to dublin in club europe cabin crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent the club europe catering was excellent i had pre-ordered a gluten-free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten-free bread the main course was beef ratatouille with a do&co dessert pot this was the best inflight meal i've had on a short haul flight on arrival in dublin the ground service from swissport was poor it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer (25 minutes) for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal, whatever happened to the world's favourite airline returning from bermuda to gatwick we were presented with a worn-out boeing 777 my seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off i had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat it didn't work tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me 'i'll put it in the book' no apology no attempt to explain just irritation from him the food was awful neither my wife or i could finish it it also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits and nothing to go on the salad my wife's entertainment screen didn't work the passenger next to me screen didn't work and mine only worked intermittently it look liked something from the arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible i believe the 777s out of gatwick are being updated can't come a moment too soon we purchased premium economy tickets for the this flight we didn't get a premium service initially i was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so i'm glad i didn't my frustration with ba grows every year we only fly with them now when we have too, kuala lumpur to miami via london in business class with british airways the business class seats were small for business class and pretty old the flight entertainment system are outdated i am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selection food choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class overall ba have to do better to be on top of their game planes has to be changed, zurich to heathrow last year they started boarding flights by groups  a week or two after the free beverages and snack service disappeared and the final nail in the coffin was pay to choose seating i decided no ba anymore i moved away from ba the only issue i have that now i have to maintain frequent flyer status with two or three separate airlines the last flight i took ba to use my avios points and i literally flew free but never to use ba again, copenhagen to amsterdam via london heathrow with british airways there was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flight but the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and i enjoyed the flight the seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh during the second flight from lhr to ams the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand like how the taxi from polderban is almost as long as the flight itself, i used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy they get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne the staff were well turned out but rushed as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew a hot meal was served an hour after take off which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese quality red and white wine was served the inflight movie selection was ok a light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports not my best flight, boarding was fairly quick the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and bags stored i was lucky that no one was sitting next me so i had some more room the pre take off drink was water or orange juice  within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef - salad was served with a good dessert wine selection was very american with jug wines the movie selection was ok the pe seats are more comfortable than economy the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference the 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies, gatwick to fort lauderdale charging to choose seats even within 24h prior take off is outrageous so if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges, venice to london city really we had a great experience with british airways we enjoyed very much flying with british airways lovely staff and great service, i forgot i had purchased a hand baggage only fare at the airport i was charged more than 60 euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost the staff at check-in could not have been less helpful the whole experience was of a bad low-cost airline boarding process saw me in category 5 having to board last not so much as a glass of water is offered the seats have very little legroom and just one toilet for the a319 economy cabin, when the passenger in front reclines his/her seat it makes it very difficult to get in and out of one's seat as the arm rests do not go all the way up the middle/window seat passengers have to climb over there is little leg room and no leg rest the boeing 777 ife screen is smaller than the ones on the british airway's 747-400s and could do with an upgrade the saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew, boston to london world traveler seats nice headrest legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines his/her seat the seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read british airways' magazine or even use my ipad we ordered special meals (halal and low sodium) the muslim meal (chicken tikka masala with naan) was restaurant quality flavorful and not spicy hot the gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like mom's the low sodium meal - herb roasted chicken tomato rice petite broccoli diced red pepper and carrots was delicious dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries the ife was very good bright and clear led screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages, london to athens we were fortunate to get exit row seats in advance they were spacious with plenty of legroom they had more width than the cramped boeing 747-400 that we had just flown in on we each had a carry on; however during the transit process british airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags  i have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags bare bones service no meals (which is okay) no complimentary soft drinks or water bottled water was available for purchase in hindsight we would have been better off flying on aegean airlines, london to johannesburg so impressed by the lady that checked us in something went wrong with my booking i was supposed to fly at 18:10 (with my boyfriend) back home to south africa after our visit in uk but somehow my ticket was booked at 21:10 we didn’t even notice that until she had brought it up at the check-in i was so shocked by the fact that i would be traveling all by myself (it’s my first trip overseas) she was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minute we obviously thought that we would not be able to sit next to each other with grateful hearts we were checking in our bags when she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft how awesome is that thank you british airways and their helpful staff, newark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy (world traveler plus) i paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg was it worth it i'd say broadly yes though i wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved before boarding: premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and india to us/canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end) so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the 2 bag allowance boarding: you board in zone 3 after first/business & the oneworld elites that is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding this means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination in flight: there is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne juice water depending on the departure time) there is also a hot towel service also 787 cabin: the 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy so a somewhat wider seat seat pitch is also decent these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much) there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades socks and toothpaste the seat back screen is large and easy to use there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy the 777 version used on the lhr-blr sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats this gives it a sort of cosy feel you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs that helped me stretch out for sure the seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats food: nothing much here i didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been it was ok - nothing to write home about all in all for such a long journey the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage worth it on extra long haul like us to india bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs, london to mumbai i have had my battles with the leadership at ba because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their airmiles now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn airmiles through their credit cards this is just to illustrate that i boarded ba199 with a slightly negative mindset a mindset which was changed quickly although i travelled economy the seat was comfortable the service excellent as was the food if i have a minor quibble the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old is this ba's attempt to reduce costs because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product i was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (eg water bottles duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine having been grumpy about several aspects of ba's service in the past i will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements, i had flown british airways from leeds bradford to london heathrow as a part of my journey back home (thailand) on the 12th december 2018 i arrived at leeds bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter check-in process took less than a minute as i already done online check-in this means i just dropped my luggage the staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful i passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (i flew economy) and no boarding groups luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand) the aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean the seat was comfortable and had a good wing view the only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily i was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem) the aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition but the crew were very friendly and very helpful the captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information as the flight departed the crew started on board service i didn't buy anything as the food option was poor expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards it was one hour flight so i didn't expect the top service standard the flight arrived at london heathrow on time despite some traffic overall the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better, gatwick to tenerife this aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring g-medk is by far the most uncomfortable plane i have ever been on i paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12a because i always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight i reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal it was like sitting on concrete i would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 i believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding it was dreadful i took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in lanzarote which coupled with there being no passengers next to me made the flight in 11f a little more bearable staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time i returned at night ten days later i normally travel easyjet on this route but on this occasion i used some avios to make the flight less expensive easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these ba flights with their diminishing attitude to customer welfare i will not use ba on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by easyjet is in my experience far superior, gatwick to barbados we flew out of gatwick on the 6th december and back on the 17th dec it started well in the newish 1st class lounge at the south terminal however the walk to the gate is miles it has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest the north terminal where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight the decor and layout is much much better i'd guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the st my first impression was how badly the \"new\" 1st class is holding up there are scuff marks everywhere surface scratches bobbles of wear on the seat fabric it's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10 in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains needs a paint job at least the motley flowers (that ba removed some years ago to save costs but re-instated) are there they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard much has been said about the seat being \"an up market business class\" - and this is true it is not a true 1st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer (i have flown both in 1st) the food is also business class quality more casual dining rather than fine dining taking one meal; it starts with an amuse bouche one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese one tomato one bit of green stuff one straggly piece of prosciutto ham total cost about 30p outstanding i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan totally utterly boring my wife had the soup which she said was nice i then had jerk chicken dish it was just about okay the glassware and chinaware was okay the cutlery was poor quality the stuff you'd expect in pizza express except the stuff in pizza express is better i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so but there is so much ba could do to improve the \"cheap\" look of their premium product quality of presentation food champagne even the menu covers they trumpet the \"superb\" laurent perrier grand siecle champagne which retails at £120 a bottle its nice but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug £20 a bottle more the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang club business class the world's most hated business class in the sky i'm a businessman and i know i could run this airline better from a quality perspective from a price perspective if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday it sort of works out okay-ish the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women, moscow to london fantastic first class service the moscow lounge was surprisingly good with excellent runway views quick boarding and i was escorted to my seat by the crew the new first seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product there's plenty of space a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space the 23 inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic the best airline meal i've had drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival the crew were very attentive and friendly with it a fantastic experience and i'll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin, johannesburg to london  for supper i asked for warm / hot water to make milky drink as i don't drink tea or coffee for health reasons given with no problems for breakfast i requested the same and i was refused i explained i don't drink tea or coffee but milk and water\" we don't keep hot water i can get it once we have finished serving all other customers\" that never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger i kept my sugar milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water explaining i have been waiting he said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back i felt like a nuisance deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing, glasgow to new york via london morning flight from gla to lhr was ok i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk on the jfk flight the service was fantastic the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight we left and arrived on time the seat and legroom was fine my mothers ife didn't work and she was moved seat which she appreciated the cabin crew were very friendly, sydney to london via singapore i'm hugely disappointed with the business class trip the seating arrangements leave little to be desired ie if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding) service is slow and once you have your food good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes if you're next to the window you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat the drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive if you do get a drink be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray i had two drinks slip off the teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it after i watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) i was scratching to find anything else decent to watch the \"new releases\" is a contradiction in terms there is very little priority giving to business class when boarding the plane sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats i would not recommend ba to anyone, johannesburg to london in contrast to our excellent outbound experience inbound lacked the wow factor the cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding the dinner service was unremarkable too and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights my ife touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month sleep quality was reasonable although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant breakfast was pretty good arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic comair flight, cape town to london very unimpressive amenities and service unless you have a bulkhead seat there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get my husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn't get the attention of steward to rectify (i gave him one of the two sets on mine) i on the other hand never got the main course i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over-cooked, bucharest to london they are not giving free food and drinks anymore you have to pay on short haul in bucharest they did not park at the terminal they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus they are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because 'the flights are too busy' avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to i have no problem with ba turning into a budget airline but at least charge accordingly otherwise it feels like we're being scammed, kuala lumpur to mexico city via london the journey from malaysia to mexico alone for business trip would be very boring however during my trip from london to mexico city on 2 dec 2018 it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me especially associated with muslim needs on food they are polite and talk to me with big smiles so when i returned back to malaysia and transit in london from mexico city on 5 dec 2018 i wished i will be able to meet them again hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip, i would like to compliment british airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight service from the crew and the food served before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company overall a very enjoyable flight from london gatwick to tampa, gatwick to las vegas boarding by group number seemed to work well at gatwick we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off the crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team ba have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best i’ve ever had on a long haul flight the aircraft was old and dated and the ife was a throwback to the 90’s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to hd quality these days all in all a very enjoyable flight, nassau to london premium economy on ba is a joke highlighted by my friday morning 7am breakfast a glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold sealed in plastic croissant and an equally sealed banana bread/cake no hot food/drink; awful that after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen  a screen no larger than in economy the only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area the extra leg room was about ok but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese ba premium economy - forget it other airlines do this better, phoenix to accra via london i had a great customer service treatment at the check in at phoenix by the young lady who checked me in she was very professional and handled my check in process excellently my entire trip was great and i really was treated very well also on my final leg to accra by the ba staff in london as well just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff, london heathrow to stuttgart absolutely disgusted with ba my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed ba had one job to do - put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in stuttgart this has proven too difficult the bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support, london to johannesburg turning right to the first wing at t5 was a new experience for us it was all pretty slick although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly mr convivial the concorde room was impressive too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design overlooking the main concourse boarding involved lining up according to group this smacked a bit of low-cost airlines but i guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane the first cabin on the a380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space the dividers seemed higher too giving better privacy the fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus cabin crew were friendly attentive and thoroughly professional food was good too and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly the wines on offer were a good selection including the fabulous lpgs and we enjoyed some wine tasting sleep quality was considerably better than club world although the cabin temperature was a little high overall an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel, vancouver to london heathrow i chose to fly with them because i had been told they were good for families and as i was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what i needed the booking process was not smooth and very stressful i have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center the 2 flights were great though the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure i was doing ok the crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok i was first given a cot for my baby i originally wanted a one of the britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot nope he was too big and could not lie straight so i asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes all the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets i'm sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant, boston to nairobi via london the only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from boston to heathrow the cabin crew service was below standard i had a window seat and twice i was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was simply because i was watching a movie i  noticed that if you didn't have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything airplane food is not exactly gourmet but ba food was so bland even the little i ate was only because i was hungry the connecting flight from heathrow to nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from boston to heathrow it looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a usb port cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard i'm probably to blame because i overrated ba before flying with them but now i know better, london to boston i was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat the flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured i was comfortable throughout the flight superb customer service, stockholm to london standard configuration on short haul european flights business class still 3 seats each side of the isle middle seat fitted with a tray had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in business drinks served with a smile and the food also food reminding of what was served in economy 10 years ago when there still was free there the best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding, amsterdam to london arrived 33 minutes late - three delays taking off landing and getting the walkway to the airplane this has happened twice this year i fly klm 90% of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely i fly british on this route  when it is significantly cheaper but am delayed i’m sure it’s bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day, heathrow to athens on a321 arrived at the airport in time and bag drop was an ease got to the gate within 30mins of bag drop with light security queues on the aircraft there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat 7f  a funny safety video played and the flight was smooth no food was served except some m&s bbc news was playing on the screens with no sound and russian captions quite confusing the plane landed half an hour late but it was the best landing i have ever experienced, london to bangkok i am not a fan if the ba configuration in business however i did have seat 2j so it was right up front i am not sure where to begin food awful i ordered beef (a showcase of british beef the notes said) that was inedible i left most of it instead of asking was something wrong or would i like another meal option the fa took the tray away and asked if i wanted dessert wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options staff challenged at best clearly some had not been in business before disengaged and disinterested the cabin was over hill for me the toilet was not checked very often a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin i would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations, gatwick to orlando stains on the seat cotton buds in the seat well disgusting and had to force them to clean no entertainment on board it was not functional internet available at three times emirates price and twice aa flight and speed that won’t achieve streaming when i complained to ba they told me i couldn’t communicate with the ceo but i could connect with their customer relations i have been gold on ba for thirty years and it’s time to ditch this \r\n",
            "non responsive airline, newcastle to las vegas via london both my flights were great on time and the food was good on the flight to london and a nice bottle of champagne as well my long haul flight was also good aircraft was 20yrs old but clean cabin crew were very nice friendly and efficient my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic the only complaint i can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved ie try showing some classic british comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of apart from that absolutely great well recommended, while it is still fresh in my mind i’d like to commend the hard working crew of my ba flight from stpetersburg to london heathrow on 23rd october 2018 the check-in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner the cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too the cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early the captain was informative my only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the m&s buy on board option was a bit tedious disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way this flight has restored my faith in ba well done to the superb crew, london to philadelphia i upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because i  wanted to experience ba’s business class in the boeing 787 but i was disappointed while the aircraft was new the staff really could have cared less about the business guests 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail ba lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite service wise was lacking pre-flight they offer you a beverage i asked for rose champagne and i was told “i guess i have to go find a bottle and open one” in my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours not on this almost 8 hour flight i was served my main meal almost 25 hours after takeoff you get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing you also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 15 hours before landing if you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley yes they have the menu linen silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable there was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it i have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no wi-fi on this flight you get a pillow duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit ba has the new planes and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service i will not pay to upgrade to business on ba and will avoid flying with them if i have another option they need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers, madrid to london good improvement this ba club europe flight was on a b777 so seats were flat beds ba have updated their menus so instead of serving a sandwich they offered a full meal service three choices of main and food was good quality good ba listened to feedback they were as always let down by their iberia partners in that their madrid business lounge was abysmal as usual with no toilets available and the lone tortilla as the unique culinary offering along with dirty tables, manchester to philadelphia via london man-lhr i am not tall so the club europe seating is fine for me on a short flight addressed by name - adequate breakfast of bacon roll fruit and yoghurt concorde room not crowded and no wait for showers lhr-phl on aged 747 but still my favorite - cabin/washrooms in very good shape though i have no problem with the ba f layout unlike so many posters here excellent flight - experienced crew and though full cabin all very smooth and professional beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank good wines as always - nice to see a good british bubbly included only downside was deplaning in phl where f passengers had to fight their way off through the j scrum - could have been controlled by crew but was not, london to vienna i was shocked that ba provides buy onboard short haul flights - no free water coffee or tea i tried to buy something but my credit card wouldn't work and i could not pay with cash, johannesburg to london i tend to stay with an airline as a frequent flyer and i fly business class i have seen a change for the worst in ba service and it does not seem to get any better bedding finally a decent pillow a very good one indeed the rest is a waste of money unless a new announced club world seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly  seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things i don't expect top food in a plane but i expect service if you announce things make sure you have them on some flights champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat premium economy however gets a sparkling wine  you must eat when they order you to eat they seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than gordon's you have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner entertainment make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view ba offers you the most limited offer, singapore to london heathrow it's my first time traveling on british airways the seat arrangement in its long-haul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward so you are face-to-face with the one sitting opposite you (at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down) there are 8 club world seats per row for 777-300er which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route the cabin service was as good as expected however i saw only chocolate bars and sweets for the minibar during night there could be some other choices, miami to london heathrow as with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with ba's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline my issue was with faulty equipment onboard issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy had to move seat and as first club and premium economy all full had to move back to economy asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear ba lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong as i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think ba now need to work on their problem solving skills i now have 91000 avios going to waste as my business will be going else where, calgary to rome via london my wife and i booked our 10th anniversary trip from calgary to rome return with british airways sept 17-27 this was my first trip in europe and we spent almost $8500 cad on first class tickets the flight calgary to london (stopover) was ok i got a bottle of water and then nobody came to the pod i was in for the next 8 hours one would have expected more from first class maybe another bottle of water they asked me to fill out what i would like for breakfast on a card i filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came the vacation itself was great on the day of the return flight our trenitalia train broke down in naples and we were 80 mins late my wife tried dozens of times to phone british airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service we tried the numbers from our tickets their website their help desk facebook page google etc we tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins and could not get through my wife managed to check herself in online but could not check me in there was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in once my wife pressed my name the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete it was a computer glitch we couldn't get around  ultimately we arrived at the rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in my wife was ok and could go through but i could not we asked the 3 ladies at the british airways desk for help and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us apparently they said it would have been different if we called before and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made they then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us they gave us another number to call my wife at this point was near tears i am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior so i was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs she was managing all the luggage the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed the attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way the new secret customer service phone number we were given did work and my wife was on the phone with customer service for over an hour after reviewing the details with several teams of specialists we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call nothing could be done for us and they could only rebook us for $8800 no apologies whatsoever were given nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in rome we eventually made it home on different airlines but i have lost all respect and trust for british airways like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support, london to bangkok flew british airways for the first time in a couple of years terminal 5 is rubbish it may look great but you have to travel further using the train services to get there and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  t5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5 i usually fly eva and others from terminal 2 and i would avoid t5 if possible from now on the aircraft interior was old and dated the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iphone 8+ (without the technology) the food was ok at best served cold to warm on both meals on both flights the crew were okay on the flight home however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them landing cards for thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag the flight had some drunks on the way back to the uk and while this isn’t the airlines fault i did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him this is the last time by choice i will ever fly british airways if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why i went with them this time) then i guess i’ll have no choice, london heathrow to miami the airport staff was very helpful the crew was also very nice and the food was delicious i had the old personal entertainment system but it works very well overall it was one of the best flights i had, london to singapore it was a wonderful flight  i was lucky having a 2-seats-row for my own on the upperdeck but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfect the crew was very friendly and the food was the best i've had on an airplane if you fly the a380 in economy book seats in the upperdeck best seats on the plane: 83a or 83k, london - pisa (return) i fly this route often as we have a house in tuscany this in all reasonableness was the best so far - but only just outbound we went through the \"first\" wing check in at t5 (we are gold card members) the breakfast we had in the lounge was just about ok the south lounge was rammed we took off on time and i declined a cooked breakfast the lady next to me had a full english and it did look rather nice the captain popped out for the loo and i caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation a very nice bloke who landed the plane superbly coming home we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm ali we had a very good lunch with the new club europe menu which came into effect two days earlier a nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation chicken downed a couple of g&ts fas on both flights were great there has been a massive improvement here on the catering side the seating is still hopeless three seats between two and zero legroom ba really should look at the competition in the far east who offer excellent regionalized business class the product is only worth it in a sale or avious points the every day fare price is ludicrous, ba34 kul-lhr 6 sept return ba11 lhr-sin-kul on 16 sept all flights in world traveller plus with the exception of sin-kul on mh economy on the kul-lhr leg the aircraft was clean and spacious in the py cabin the seats were the biggest let down whilst there was adequate legroom they were hard and uncomfortable especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support the headrest did not move at all the seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which i think is a missed opportunity by ba to maximise utilisation of space the food was okay you get two meals the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke ife was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging the return flight was on an a380 excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight again seats were the same but the a380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin staff were less conspicuous this time around overall i would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats, british airways is my favorite airline boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean the staff was professional food was above expectation during 7 hours flight staff is always there captain kept updating us about weather turbulence and time, rome to newark via london the first sector was on a a319 flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time boarding at fco was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2 flight attendants friendly and welcoming seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight there was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water no entertainment either was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the m&s menu connection at t5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon boarding for the flight to newark was organised and painless i was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped happy to say the seat comfort was pretty good legroom was manageable i was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked) it was pretty dirty there was grime around the usb port (which didn't work) tv screen and along the floor by the wall the cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well i found the touchscreen ife to be outdated and slightly slow in response the selection was not as extensive but i did find some excellent british content that i had not seen before the real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly professional and warm they were with their service they were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick the main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing all in all a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector, london heathrow to new york jfk the first wing at terminal 5 was rubbish tonight 20 or so deep and it’s really the only decent part of ba’s ground operation flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at kennedy made us overall late staff very cheerful this route gets decent catering normally but only 3 main options and the indian chicken was very bland, london heathrow to dubai this was the first time i had flown in first class  on ba i had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed ba's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates we were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the ba fleet the cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious the sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy it is nice they offer a male and female kit my wife was delighted with the contents the champagne that ba offer in first is superb i enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne i have tasted choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the johnnie walker blue label if you are a whiskey drinker food was very tasty and well presented i had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then lamb machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille we were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing i cant really fault any of it it was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too ife was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing i believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787 i do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice the thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew from the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous attentive with out being over-bearing witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need they were superb wifi was available but the page to connect didn't load up when i tried it i dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer this was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first whether i would choose it over club world would be on flight by flight basis you have to do it once though, flew madrid to london heathrow the 767 is ancient and ba have clearly given up on hiding that fact i guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon i love flying in 767s the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and ba should definitely improve this aside from this the flight was really very good indeed ba business class has in my experience always been consistent consistently good ba cabin crew in business class are a real asset this was one of ba's more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere the flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks i'll be sad to see the 767s go but the time has come, london heathrow to brindisi we weren’t expecting the long queue for club europe check-in but mid-afternoon is apparently particularly busy in t5 galleries south lounge was also teeming but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food group boarding was handled efficiently the a321 was relatively new and clean no pre-take-off drinks were offered departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time the club europe section was unusually busy with at least ten fully occupied rows including families with pre-school children despite the congestion and chaos the food and drink service was handled efficiently although the food was no better than the old world traveller offering it’s hard to see the point of ba’s short haul business class product when the experience is second rate, i have ba silver membership this promises fast track choice of seats at booking priority boarding and lounge access i would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst the majority of the time my seat choice is changed fast track at heathrow is slower than the normal queue and the lounges so overcrowded that it's sometimes hard to find a seat the iberia lounge at madrid is equality poor with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast british airways is a rip off i have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their a321 and seat 22c this seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others yet on bacom they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom i recently travelled on virgin atlantic and cathay pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal ba/iberia are by comparison, glasgow to miami via london glasgow to heathrow was painless as was transfer to t3 heathrow to miami on aging 747 flight delayed by an hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe to board kept informed by gate team about progress  tv screen tiny and poor choices of entertainment plane was looking it's age and a bit run down around the edges premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on a380 what made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin polite efficient welcoming and nothing was any bother for her service with a smile from start to finish  people in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job also meals and drink selection very good although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done ba and looking forward to return journey, budapest to london heathrow the flight departed in time and would have arrived ahead of schedule if the gate had not been occupied by the previous aircraft the ride was a bit bumpy but was not too serious the flight was full (with kids) and the crew did everything to make the journey smooth i did not purchase any food but i saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of on-board purchases, london to toronto group of 10 people age from 2 to over 60 business class seating in 787/9 very conducive for family travelling allows for interaction forward business class cabin on 787 is fairly private service on both flights was flawless very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the meals food presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantastic outstanding crew on ba 603 and ba 99 - on our outgoing flights from toronto on august 16 similar great service ba gets often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a bad experience their seating arrangement in club world is perfect when travelling with family other carriers may have an advantage if one travels alone, singapore to london they wanted to charge me an extra gbp65 for being over the 23kg limit the legroom seemed very small to me the flight was super full and i was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat i was asked if i would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come back with the tea after a long time i managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea, washington to frankfurt via london check-in at dulles airport was smooth i asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did even though at the online check-in there was none available boeing 747-400 was 27 years old the ife was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad the seats were ok pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good my seat was 27a and i had the whole row for myself unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his ife and they would replace him on 27c shortly after take-off the service began there were 2 food options available chicken and vegatarian lasagne i went for the lasagne which was ok nothing special it came with a salad a bread bun and a black forest cake all in all an ok meal nothing to complain about the crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying after dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep i tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature ife in the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle connecting in heathrow is pretty easy (in t5) there are signs everywhere security went fast there is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free wifi we boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds ba started to do a buy-on-board service which i hate however i thought the pricing was ok, i always like travelling on a ba a380 seats in economy class are comfortable and always able to sleep which is rare on other airlines or types of planes however the food is really poor in the last 12 months i have had some of the worst airline food served from ba or cathay pacific and this includes my most recent travels with british airways thankfully ba airline staff are always the best, london heathrow to düsseldorf really good crew on both legs of the journey got to board first and let crew know about the fact i was flying solo with slight autism and they kept me safe the entire flight which was a bonus loved the fact that they asked if i was ok on board too, london heathrow to singapore had a great experience in the concorde room and galleries first lounges in heathrow t5 i was warmly greeted by a member of the crew who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around all because i expressed a slight interest and for that i am thankful the flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit the seat was very well presented there was a small amenity kit as well as a pair of pyjamas the seat was clean with pillows as well as ample storage space you get a closet to hang clothes a little compartment next to the seat as well as the overhead bin so i never ran out of room the pre-departure beverage was a choice of water orange juice or champagne and hot towels were handed out the flight left slightly behind schedule but at heathrow this is something you expect very soon after take-off the crew began serving dinner i had already booked my meal in advance but the choice of starters mains and deserts as well as the beverage menu was very good the meal i had was exceptionally tasty and i would have it again once dinner service had finished the crew turned down the bed for me whilst i went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided the bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall i did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out there were plenty of blankets and pillows available and i slept very well when i awoke i was offered coffee and a short while later breakfast the breakfast choices were continental or cooked i opted for the cooked option and i was not disappointed as it was very tasty and there was a lot of it the inflight entertainment was good and there was a large range of films tv programmes/series audio books and kids programmes to choose from the system was responsive and was good quality although i did not watch any films so i cannot speak of the sound quality the crew served with a smile and even when i asked for a latte which the machine didn’t do the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice they really made this already special experience even more special if you want to treat yourself to ba first i would thoroughly recommend it, toronto to lhr and lgw to toronto return in wt+ finally ba has moved back into it’s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture however premium plaza still staff and operate the lounge food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor slick boarding and a full pe cabin on a 777 water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights to london (apparently 3 are loaded in london for the o/w leg but none for the return) friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service fast bar service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul salty dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables the salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross got a couple of hours sleep however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working a reset halfway through the flight worked though two loud renditions of delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up the standard t&cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is (ba should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) after leaving toronto 5 mins late we arrived 5 early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags for the return leg i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane gatwick airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with ba fast track customers excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food and champagne available as a help yourself efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew a fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow – more experienced faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service fast bar service once airborne followed by the old biz food service overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option plenty of wine and drinks along with t&c after a pleasant 3 hour nap i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues at the gate early and fast bags too this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu i hope gatwick catches up so ba don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative on the o/w leg premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp the food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat all that said i felt that ba is regaining it’s mojo with great crew improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance long may this improvement last, san francisco to london heathrow on the lower deck of the a380 - a very quiet smooth flight did not want to pay the usual ba extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together after the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order struggle to get through to priority lane announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable if narrow seats of course the usual ba club class \"scramble over the legs\" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive business class world welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive fa ok meal - beef - with decent wines to accompany much more up to date touch screen avod system but still a dreadful choice of \"blockbuster\" films very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it really very good fa's - made you feel welcome landed on time but baggage for some reason took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt as usual i have mixed feelings about ba - if we are lucky enough to fly club/business class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seat if virgin atlantic fly the same route i will always choose their upper class as everyone has aisle access and you don't have to pay to pre-reserve your seat, london to dublin this was an early morning departure from heathrow on a full flight ba managed everything in a very professional manner the bag-drop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules the cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video during this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression i had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb, london to paris i wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it that being said this is better than any low-cost carrier, delivering outstanding customer service onboard british airways may not have the cleanest newest or comfortable aircraft but their customer service has always been a delight  since i have flown with them, this was a night flight new york jfk to london so it was difficult to assess the service onboard although what i experienced was certainly not bad i think this was a very quiet flight judging from the number of people around the gate and there were only another 4-5 pax in first but it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin the former felt very exclusive but as commented elsewhere to the point of being fussy it's irritating that they don't have any showers in the concorde room; i wasn't amused to check in at the galleries (business) lounge be brusquely sent on to concorde only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm early august in nyc - of course i needed a shower) departures from ny were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway but we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne seved by various members of the crew likewise all the perks of first class were there; i was addressed by name the crew introduced themselves individually dinner and drinks orders were taken etc all very courteous and professional after such a long delay i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine and was served promptly so there was still plenty of time for sleep but the soup was cold and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class moreover it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had i known this i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t5 arrivals toiletsperhaps you saw me) the cabin layout and bed: well it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online but it's certainly nothing special for first class overall a very acceptable flight but i felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing (where can i have a shower in the morning where will i be having breakfast) i've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects, paphos to london gatwick in club europe we had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed as were many other flights due to bad weather the previous evening in uk we checked in on time only to be advised that there was no lounge available for club europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay whilst we appreciate that there may not be a ba lounge it is normal that ba would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class we were offered a €10 voucher each due to the delayed flight paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with ba that no lounge access was available the flight itself was ok although two hours late the cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable my wife chose the chilli con carne and i chose the roasted chicken both were a little dry on arrival at gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered again very poor show ba has some great assets particularly the cabin crew but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case ba were lacking, gatwick to paphos in club europe we travelled on the first saturday of the school holidays and whilst gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad we expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats the flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue we are used the ba's club europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable service from the cabin crew was good it is nice that ba have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in club europe and now serve by the glass the meal service was quite good we both chose the chicken curry for the main course which was tasty and not dried out flight arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule very happy with the service\n"
